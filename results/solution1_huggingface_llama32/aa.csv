Korea did not request \ntechnical compliance re-ratings in its three previous enhanced Follow Up Reports (FUR) \n(2021-23). This 4th enhanced FUR analyses Korea’s progress in addressing the technical \ncompliance deficiencies identified in its MER, relating to Recommendation 8. A re-rating is \ngiven where sufficient progress has been made. \nOverall, the expectation is that countries will have addressed most, if not all, technical \ncompliance deficiencies by the end of the third year from the adoption of their MER. This \nreport does not address what progress Korea has made to improve its effectiveness.  \nThe following expert, supported by Ms. Lisa Kilduff, Policy Analyst within the FATF \nSecretariat, assessed Korea’s request for technical compliance re-ratings:  \n• \nMr. Ian McDonald, Senior Policy Analyst, Royal Canadian Mounted Police \nfrom Canada. \nThe second section of this report summarises Korea’s progress in improving technical \ncompliance. The third section sets out the conclusion and includes a table showing Korea’s \nMER ratings and updated ratings based on this and previous FURs. \nProgress to improve Technical Compliance \nThis section summarises Korea’s progress to improve its technical compliance by addressing \nsome of the technical compliance deficiencies identified in the MER (R.8). \nProgress to address technical compliance deficiencies identified in the \nMER \nKorea has made progress to address the technical compliance deficiencies identified in the \nMER in relation to R.8. Because of this progress, Korea has been re-rated on this \nRecommendation. \n \n1  www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Mutualevaluations/Mer-korea-2020.html  \n2 |       \nKOREA: FOURTH ENHANCED FOLLOW-UP REPORT \n      \nRecommendation 8  \n \nYear  \nRating \nMER  \n2020 \nPC \nFUR1 \n2021 \nPC (not re-assessed) \nFUR2 \n2022 \nPC (not re-assessed) \nFUR3 \n2023 \nPC (not re-assessed) \nFUR4 \n2024 \n↑LC \nCriterion 8.1 (Mostly Met) \nKorea did not fully meet the requirements of this criterion at the time of the \nMER as it had not clearly identified which registered NPOs fell within the FATF \ndefinition of Non-Profit Organisations (NPO). Furthermore, Korea’s definition \nof ‘public interest corporation’ (PIC) did not strictly align with the FATF \ndefinition (c.8.1(a)). Since its MER, Korea has taken steps to identify which \nNPOs fall within the FATF definition. As of 2022, Korea identified that there \nwas a total of 53 918 Non-Profit Corporations (NPCs) in Korea, which were \nregistered with the National Tax Service (NTS) based on in the Corporate Tax \nAct and the Value-added Act. These NPCs all received their unique \nidentification numbers issued from the competent tax offices. In consultation \nwith the NPO sector, Korea has since imposed the duty of disclosure on NPCs \nto monitor tax evasion, misappropriation of funds and other illicit activities \nand to protect the legitimate activities of NPOs. It has done so by stipulating \nthat a person who conducts business for purposes of public service, related to \nreligion, charity, or academic studies under the Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax \nAct constitutes a Public Service Corporation (PSC). As of 2022, there were a \ntotal of 39,273 PSCs that are subject to disclosure requirements under the \nInheritance Tax and Gift Tax Act (art. 50.3). In general, all PSCs in Korea have \na duty of disclosure to report settlement statements. However, organisations \nthat are determined to be contributing to religious propagation and \nreformation of the people are exempt from this disclosure. As well, small PSCs \nare allowed to make this report through a simple form, to ensure that the \nreporting requirement reflects the risk-based approach being used in Korea. \nKorea has identified 309 internationally active NPOs and 159 NPOs \nconducting religious activities as being at higher risk of TF abuse, and these \nNPOs are subject to the full reporting requirement and cannot qualify for \nsimplified reporting measures. Korea has therefore addressed the deficiency \nidentified in the MER under c.8.1(a). \nWhile the 2020 MER found that Korea had made efforts to identify the nature \nof TF threats posed to at-risk NPOs, some of the threats identified were very \ngeneral and information provided on TF threats and vulnerabilities were \nlargely based on international studies and lacked specificity in the Korean \ncontext (c.8.1(b)). In 2023, Korea undertook an assessment of the risks facing \nthe NPO sector. This was based on analyses of STR statistics, TF crime \ntypologies and interviews with representative agencies from the NPO sector. \nThe assessment concluded that NPOs with an international presence are more \nlikely to be at risk to TF abuse than domestically active NPOs in Korea. The \nstudy resulted in findings and guidance that was issued to representative \nagencies as a result by KoFIU. However, limited information has been \nprovided on the extent to which Korea identifies the nature nature of threats \n      | 3 \nKOREA: FOURTH ENHANCED FOLLOW-UP REPORT \n      \nposed by terrorist entities to the NPOs which are at risk as well as how \nterrorist actors abuse those NPOs. The deficiency under c.8.1(b) has only been \naddressed to some extent and the deficiency remains. \nAs set out in 2020, KoFIU undertakes reviews of the adequacy of Korea’s \nmeasures to prevent TF abuse of at-risk NPOs, and the legislative framework \nwas considered adequate and risk based. No technical shortcomings were \nidentified (c.8.1(c)). Similarly, Korea has periodically reassessed the NPO \nsector to review up-to-date information on its vulnerabilities, the most recent \nof which was undertaken in 2023. The NPOs CFT Agencies Committee meets \non an ad hoc basis to discuss issues as they arise, including new information \non risks and vulnerabilities. No technical shortcomings were identified \n(c.8.1(d)). While Korea has addressed deficiencies under c.8.1(a) and made \nprogress regarding c.8.1(b) to some extent, shortcomings remain under this \nsub-criterion. Criterion 8.1 remains mostly met. \nCriterion 8.2 (Met)  \nKorea did not fully meet the requirements of this criterion at the time of the \nMER due to deficiencies under c.8.2(a)-(c). The MER found that the Guidelines \non Combating TF Abuse of NPOs were not comprehensive, and while certain \nNPOs were subject to measures and obligations that aim to increase \ntransparency \nand \naccountability \nand \nprevent \nTF, \nKorea \nlacked \ncomprehensive policies aimed at promoting accountability, integrity and \npublic confidence for all NPOs (c.8.2(a)). As at the time of the MER, there are \npolicies in place regarding the establishment, control and supervision of PICs \nunder the Act on the Establishment and Operation of Public Interest \nCorporations. As noted under c.8.1, since the MER, Korea has established \npolicies regarding PSCs under the Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax Act, which are \nsubject to reporting requirements and oversight by the NTS. Under the \nInheritance Tax and Gift Tax Act, PSCs are required to: undertake public \nfinancial reporting, including details on collection and disbursement of \ndonations (art. 50.3); apply accounting standards (art. 50.4); keep records \nand preserve significant evidentiary documents for 10 years from the last date \nof a taxable period of income tax or a business year of corporate tax (art. 51), \nand; undergo tax verification and audit (art. 50). Korea has therefore \ndemonstrated that there are policies in place to promote accountability, \nintegrity and public confidence in the administration of NPOs, and the \ndeficiency under c.8.2(a) has been addressed. \nRegarding c.8.2(b), the MER identified shortcomings in Korea’s outreach \nefforts, noting that they did not include certain high-risk NPOs or donor \ncommunities. Since 2020, the Korean government has reinforced its outreach \nactivities to strengthen awareness among NPOs about their potential \nvulnerabilities to TF risks and abuse. Such activities include holding a \nroundtable meeting with three representative agencies from the NPO sector \n(GuideStar, KCOC, KCMS), with a focus on internationally active NPOs \nconsidered at-risk to TF abuse and working alongside NPOs to develop \neducational materials on the subject. The technical shortcomings have \ntherefore been addressed under c.8.2(b).  \nWhile the KoFIU Guidelines on Combatting TF Abuse of NPOs include best \npractices for addressing TF risks and vulnerabilities, the MER noted a minor \n4 |       \nKOREA: FOURTH ENHANCED FOLLOW-UP REPORT \n      \ndeficiency regarding the lack of NPO input into the development or \nrefinement of the guidelines (c.8.2(c)). Since the MER, in addition to the \nguidelines, Korea has developed checklists that allow the NPO sector to self-\nassess their exposure to potential TF risks and abuse, which can be filtered by \nregulation, area of activity and risk level. The three representative agencies \n(GuideStar, KCOC, KCMS) participated in the development of said checklists, \nwhich have been distributed to at-risk NPOs. Considering this progress, the \ntechnical deficiencies under c.8.2(c) have been addressed. \nAs set out in 2020, all NPOs are required to use regulated financial channels \nand provide information on their accounts to the NTS (Inheritance Tax and \nGift Tax Act, art.50-2). Development aid NPOs are also subject to additional \nrequirements to conduct transactions through certified bank accounts or \nregulated financial channels (Korea International Cooperation Agency Act, \nart.22-2). No technical deficiencies were identified (c.8.2(d)). Considering the \nprogress made under c.8.2(a)-(c), this criterion is now considered met. \nCriterion 8.3 (Mostly Met)  \nThe 2020 MER found that while Korea had some measures in place to promote \nsupervision and monitoring of NPOs and demonstrate that the measures \napplied to NPOs were risk-based, half of the country’s higher-risk NPO \npopulation were not subject to adequate reporting or disclosure \nrequirements. As noted under c.8.1, PSCs are now subject to reporting \nrequirements under the Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax Act, including NPOs \nidentified as higher risk2. NPOs that are not defined as a PSC but that have \nprofit-making business must submit financial statements to the competent tax \noffice (art. 60, Corporate Tax Act) and report the inheritance tax, if the \norganisation receives tangible or intangible property (art. 4.2, Inheritance Tax \nand Gift Tax Act). NPOs identified as high risk are now subject to duty of \ndisclosure and subsequent monitoring, as noted under c.8.1(a). However, it is \nnot entirely clear if NPOs that  submit a simpler disclosure form are doing so \nbecause of their asset size alone or if there is consideration of the TF risk. \nKorea has made progress in ensuring that NPOs at risk of TF abuse are subject \nto monitoring and supervision, but gaps remain in the application of risk-\nbased supervision. \nCriterion 8.4 (Partly Met)  \nAs outlined under c.8.3, the 2020 MER found deficiencies regarding the \nmonitoring of higher-risk NPOs in Korea. While the MER notes that many \nNPOs are subject to ongoing and strict scrutiny to prevent misuse of public \nfunds, which indirectly contributes to TF prevention, this does not extend to \nall NPOs identified as high risk (c.8.4(a)). Furthermore, monitoring is focused \non criminal activity rather than compliance with R.8 requirements. The MER \ndid however note that Korea’s monitoring and supervisions systems were \ngenerally consistent with Korea’s risk profile. The efforts undertaken by \n \n2  There are nine organisations that are exempt from reporting requirements, five of which do \nnot meet the definition of NPO under the FATF Standards and four that failed to comply with \ndisclosure obligations pursuant to Article 50.3 of the Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax Act. In \ncase of failure to comply with this obligation in 2024, they will be required to pay additional \ntax pursuant to Article 78.11 of the Act. \n      | 5 \nKOREA: FOURTH ENHANCED FOLLOW-UP REPORT \n      \nKorea on outreach and guidance through the self-checklist as described under \nc.8.2 are useful tools for improving understanding of TF risks on the part of \nNPOs. However, these efforts do not address the deficiency identified in the \nMER under c.8.4(a), namely that monitoring efforts for compliance continue \nto be secondary compared to monitoring of suspected ML/TF activity. The \ntechnical deficiencies under c.8.4(a) therefore remain. \nRegarding c.8.4(b), as set out in 2020, Korea has some ability to apply \neffective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions for violations of the \nrequirements applicable to NPOs. Registrars can deregister NPOs for breaches \nof their financial reporting obligations (Civil Act, art.38; Act on the \nEstablishment and Operation of Public Interest Corporations, art.16) and the \nNTS can also sanction such breaches by imposing additional tax. While no \nsanctions are available for the NPO’s officers, where a NPO collects donations \noutside its specified collection plan, the NPO or its officer(s) can face \nimprisonment of up to three years or a fine of KRW 30 million (EUR 23 500) \n(Act on Collection and Use of Donations, art.4, 10, 16). The MER deemed the \nrange of sanctions available to be relatively limited, which may reduce Korea’s \nability to impose proportionate sanctions. Korea does not appear to have \nmade new sanctions available for breaches of compliance with R.8 and the \ntechnical shortcomings remain. The deficiencies remain under c.8.4. \nCriterion 8.5 (Met)  \nKorea did not fully meet the requirements of this criterion at the time of the \nMER. While Korea ensures cooperation and coordination between authorities \nwith information on NPOs through the NPOs CFT Agencies Committee, this \ncommittee and other mechanisms did not include all NPO registrars, which \nwas deemed as detrimental to information sharing on NPOs (c.8.5(a)). Since \nthe MER, to promote effective cooperation, coordination, and information \nexchange between related agencies that hold NPO information, the NPO CFT \nAgencies Committee was established under the purview of the KoFIU. \nParticipating agencies include the Office for Government Coordination, \nNational Intelligence Service, Ministry of the Interior and Safety, NTS, National \nPolice Agency, Financial Supervisory Service, and Korea International \nCooperation Agency (KOICA). The consultative group adjourns to discuss \npolicies, inspections, education and outreach programmes and information \nsharing, with a focus on how to protect NPOs from TF abuse. As NPOs are now \ndefined as Public Service Corporations under the Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax \nAct, the NTS is the competent authority that manages and oversees the \nregistration of NPOs in Korea (as of 2022). The NTS takes part in the Council, \nand as such, the deficiency identified under c.8.5(a) has been resolved. \nAs set out in 2020, competent authorities can carry out investigations into \nNPOs suspected of TF abuse (c.8.5(b)), the NPA is able to obtain information \non the administration and management of NPOs through various channels \n(c.8.5(c)) and the NPOs CFT Agencies Committee and Counter-Terrorism \nCommittee provide mechanisms for sharing suspicions of NPO abuse with \nrelevant authorities, including the NPA for investigation. NPO registrars are \naware of the TF risks in the sector, in part due to outreach on this topic, and \nknow to report any suspicions to the NPA (c.8.5(d)). No technical deficiencies \nwere identified regarding c.8.5(b)-(d). Given that the technical shortcoming \nunder c.8.5(a) has been addressed, this criterion is now met.  \n6 |       \nKOREA: FOURTH ENHANCED FOLLOW-UP REPORT \n      \nCriterion 8.6 (Met) \nAs set out in 2020, international requests for information regarding NPOs \nsuspected of TF abuse are dealt with in the same was as any other request for \ninformation. KoFIU, the NPA or other competent authorities can informally \nprovide information as described in R.40 of the MER. Where one agency \nreceives a request for information relevant to another agency, the NPOs CFT \nAgencies Committee provides contact points through which such requests can \nbe shared. Foreign parties may also obtain public financial or administrative \ninformation through GuideStar or the NTS. \nWeighting and conclusion: Korea has taken steps to address the deficiencies identified in \nits 2020 MER. Korea has identified which NPOs fall within the FATF definition and since \n2022, subjected PSCs to duty of disclosure under the Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax Act. These \nPSCs are subject to supervision and monitoring, in line with the risk-based approach. KoFIU \nundertakes reviews of the adequacy of Korea’s measures to prevent TF abuse of at-risk NPOs, \nand the legislative framework is adequate and risk based. Korea periodically reassesses the \nNPO sector to review up-to-date information on its vulnerabilities and the NPOs CFT \nAgencies Committee meets on an ad hoc basis. Korea ensures that NPOs are subject to \nmeasures and obligations that aim to increase transparency and accountability and prevent \nTF and has established policies to promote accountability, integrity and public confidence in \nthe administration of NPOs under the Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax Act. Outreach efforts and \nactivities have been strengthened through roundtable meetings with representative agencies \nfrom the NPO sector with a focus on internationally active NPOs considered at-risk to TF \nabuse. With the participation of representative agencies, Korea has developed checklists that \nallow the NPO sector to self-assess their exposure to potential TF risks and abuse, and all \nNPOs are required to use regulated financial channels and provide information on their \naccounts to the NTS. Korea ensures that there are effective information gathering and \ncoordination mechanisms in place, namely through the NPO CFT Agencies Committee, and \ncompetent authorities can carry out investigations into NPOs suspected of TF abuse. \nInformation is readily available to competent authorities and NPO registrars are aware of the \nTF risks in the sector. KoFIU deals with international requests for information regarding \nNPOs suspected of TF abuse adequately.     \nHowever, some deficiencies remain. While Korea has made efforts to identify the nature of \nTF threats posed to at-risk NPOs, some of the threats identified were very general and \ninformation provided on TF threats and vulnerabilities were largely based on international \nstudies and lacked specificity in the Korean context. Korea has made progress in ensuring \nthat NPOs at risk of TF abuse are subject to monitoring and supervision, but gaps remain in \nthe application of risk-based supervision. Monitoring efforts for compliance continue to be \nsecondary compared to monitoring of suspected ML/TF activity, and while Korea has some \nability to apply effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions for violations of the \nrequirements applicable to NPOs, the range of sanctions available is relatively limited. \nConsidering the progress made and taking into account Korea’s risk and context,  \nRecommendation 8 is re-rated as Largely Compliant. \n \n \n      | 7 \nKOREA: FOURTH ENHANCED FOLLOW-UP REPORT \n      \nConclusion \nOverall, Korea has made progress in addressing technical compliance deficiencies identified \nin its MER and has been re-rated Largely Compliant with R.8.  \nThe table below shows Korea’s MER ratings and reflects the progress it has made, and any \nre-ratings based on this and previous FURs: \nTable 1.

Korea did not request \ntechnical compliance re-ratings in its three previous enhanced Follow Up Reports (FUR) \n(2021-23). This 4th enhanced FUR analyses Korea’s progress in addressing the technical \ncompliance deficiencies identified in its MER, relating to Recommendation 8. A re-rating is \ngiven where sufficient progress has been made. \nOverall, the expectation is that countries will have addressed most, if not all, technical \ncompliance deficiencies by the end of the third year from the adoption of their MER. This \nreport does not address what progress Korea has made to improve its effectiveness.  \nThe following expert, supported by Ms. Lisa Kilduff, Policy Analyst within the FATF \nSecretariat, assessed Korea’s request for technical compliance re-ratings:  \n• \nMr. Ian McDonald, Senior Policy Analyst, Royal Canadian Mounted Police \nfrom Canada. \nThe second section of this report summarises Korea’s progress in improving technical \ncompliance. The third section sets out the conclusion and includes a table showing Korea’s \nMER ratings and updated ratings based on this and previous FURs. \nProgress to improve Technical Compliance \nThis section summarises Korea’s progress to improve its technical compliance by addressing \nsome of the technical compliance deficiencies identified in the MER (R.8). \nProgress to address technical compliance deficiencies identified in the \nMER \nKorea has made progress to address the technical compliance deficiencies identified in the \nMER in relation to R.8. Because of this progress, Korea has been re-rated on this \nRecommendation. \n \n1  www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Mutualevaluations/Mer-korea-2020.html  \n2 |       \nKOREA: FOURTH ENHANCED FOLLOW-UP REPORT \n      \nRecommendation 8  \n \nYear  \nRating \nMER  \n2020 \nPC \nFUR1 \n2021 \nPC (not re-assessed) \nFUR2 \n2022 \nPC (not re-assessed) \nFUR3 \n2023 \nPC (not re-assessed) \nFUR4 \n2024 \n↑LC \nCriterion 8.1 (Mostly Met) \nKorea did not fully meet the requirements of this criterion at the time of the \nMER as it had not clearly identified which registered NPOs fell within the FATF \ndefinition of Non-Profit Organisations (NPO). Furthermore, Korea’s definition \nof ‘public interest corporation’ (PIC) did not strictly align with the FATF \ndefinition (c.8.1(a)). Since its MER, Korea has taken steps to identify which \nNPOs fall within the FATF definition. As of 2022, Korea identified that there \nwas a total of 53 918 Non-Profit Corporations (NPCs) in Korea, which were \nregistered with the National Tax Service (NTS) based on in the Corporate Tax \nAct and the Value-added Act. These NPCs all received their unique \nidentification numbers issued from the competent tax offices. In consultation \nwith the NPO sector, Korea has since imposed the duty of disclosure on NPCs \nto monitor tax evasion, misappropriation of funds and other illicit activities \nand to protect the legitimate activities of NPOs. It has done so by stipulating \nthat a person who conducts business for purposes of public service, related to \nreligion, charity, or academic studies under the Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax \nAct constitutes a Public Service Corporation (PSC). As of 2022, there were a \ntotal of 39,273 PSCs that are subject to disclosure requirements under the \nInheritance Tax and Gift Tax Act (art. 50.3). In general, all PSCs in Korea have \na duty of disclosure to report settlement statements. However, organisations \nthat are determined to be contributing to religious propagation and \nreformation of the people are exempt from this disclosure. As well, small PSCs \nare allowed to make this report through a simple form, to ensure that the \nreporting requirement reflects the risk-based approach being used in Korea. \nKorea has identified 309 internationally active NPOs and 159 NPOs \nconducting religious activities as being at higher risk of TF abuse, and these \nNPOs are subject to the full reporting requirement and cannot qualify for \nsimplified reporting measures. Korea has therefore addressed the deficiency \nidentified in the MER under c.8.1(a). \nWhile the 2020 MER found that Korea had made efforts to identify the nature \nof TF threats posed to at-risk NPOs, some of the threats identified were very \ngeneral and information provided on TF threats and vulnerabilities were \nlargely based on international studies and lacked specificity in the Korean \ncontext (c.8.1(b)). In 2023, Korea undertook an assessment of the risks facing \nthe NPO sector. This was based on analyses of STR statistics, TF crime \ntypologies and interviews with representative agencies from the NPO sector. \nThe assessment concluded that NPOs with an international presence are more \nlikely to be at risk to TF abuse than domestically active NPOs in Korea. The \nstudy resulted in findings and guidance that was issued to representative \nagencies as a result by KoFIU. However, limited information has been \nprovided on the extent to which Korea identifies the nature nature of threats \n      | 3 \nKOREA: FOURTH ENHANCED FOLLOW-UP REPORT \n      \nposed by terrorist entities to the NPOs which are at risk as well as how \nterrorist actors abuse those NPOs. The deficiency under c.8.1(b) has only been \naddressed to some extent and the deficiency remains. \nAs set out in 2020, KoFIU undertakes reviews of the adequacy of Korea’s \nmeasures to prevent TF abuse of at-risk NPOs, and the legislative framework \nwas considered adequate and risk based. No technical shortcomings were \nidentified (c.8.1(c)). Similarly, Korea has periodically reassessed the NPO \nsector to review up-to-date information on its vulnerabilities, the most recent \nof which was undertaken in 2023. The NPOs CFT Agencies Committee meets \non an ad hoc basis to discuss issues as they arise, including new information \non risks and vulnerabilities. No technical shortcomings were identified \n(c.8.1(d)). While Korea has addressed deficiencies under c.8.1(a) and made \nprogress regarding c.8.1(b) to some extent, shortcomings remain under this \nsub-criterion. Criterion 8.1 remains mostly met. \nCriterion 8.2 (Met)  \nKorea did not fully meet the requirements of this criterion at the time of the \nMER due to deficiencies under c.8.2(a)-(c). The MER found that the Guidelines \non Combating TF Abuse of NPOs were not comprehensive, and while certain \nNPOs were subject to measures and obligations that aim to increase \ntransparency \nand \naccountability \nand \nprevent \nTF, \nKorea \nlacked \ncomprehensive policies aimed at promoting accountability, integrity and \npublic confidence for all NPOs (c.8.2(a)). As at the time of the MER, there are \npolicies in place regarding the establishment, control and supervision of PICs \nunder the Act on the Establishment and Operation of Public Interest \nCorporations. As noted under c.8.1, since the MER, Korea has established \npolicies regarding PSCs under the Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax Act, which are \nsubject to reporting requirements and oversight by the NTS. Under the \nInheritance Tax and Gift Tax Act, PSCs are required to: undertake public \nfinancial reporting, including details on collection and disbursement of \ndonations (art. 50.3); apply accounting standards (art. 50.4); keep records \nand preserve significant evidentiary documents for 10 years from the last date \nof a taxable period of income tax or a business year of corporate tax (art. 51), \nand; undergo tax verification and audit (art. 50). Korea has therefore \ndemonstrated that there are policies in place to promote accountability, \nintegrity and public confidence in the administration of NPOs, and the \ndeficiency under c.8.2(a) has been addressed. \nRegarding c.8.2(b), the MER identified shortcomings in Korea’s outreach \nefforts, noting that they did not include certain high-risk NPOs or donor \ncommunities. Since 2020, the Korean government has reinforced its outreach \nactivities to strengthen awareness among NPOs about their potential \nvulnerabilities to TF risks and abuse. Such activities include holding a \nroundtable meeting with three representative agencies from the NPO sector \n(GuideStar, KCOC, KCMS), with a focus on internationally active NPOs \nconsidered at-risk to TF abuse and working alongside NPOs to develop \neducational materials on the subject. The technical shortcomings have \ntherefore been addressed under c.8.2(b).  \nWhile the KoFIU Guidelines on Combatting TF Abuse of NPOs include best \npractices for addressing TF risks and vulnerabilities, the MER noted a minor \n4 |       \nKOREA: FOURTH ENHANCED FOLLOW-UP REPORT \n      \ndeficiency regarding the lack of NPO input into the development or \nrefinement of the guidelines (c.8.2(c)). Since the MER, in addition to the \nguidelines, Korea has developed checklists that allow the NPO sector to self-\nassess their exposure to potential TF risks and abuse, which can be filtered by \nregulation, area of activity and risk level. The three representative agencies \n(GuideStar, KCOC, KCMS) participated in the development of said checklists, \nwhich have been distributed to at-risk NPOs. Considering this progress, the \ntechnical deficiencies under c.8.2(c) have been addressed. \nAs set out in 2020, all NPOs are required to use regulated financial channels \nand provide information on their accounts to the NTS (Inheritance Tax and \nGift Tax Act, art.50-2). Development aid NPOs are also subject to additional \nrequirements to conduct transactions through certified bank accounts or \nregulated financial channels (Korea International Cooperation Agency Act, \nart.22-2). No technical deficiencies were identified (c.8.2(d)). Considering the \nprogress made under c.8.2(a)-(c), this criterion is now considered met. \nCriterion 8.3 (Mostly Met)  \nThe 2020 MER found that while Korea had some measures in place to promote \nsupervision and monitoring of NPOs and demonstrate that the measures \napplied to NPOs were risk-based, half of the country’s higher-risk NPO \npopulation were not subject to adequate reporting or disclosure \nrequirements. As noted under c.8.1, PSCs are now subject to reporting \nrequirements under the Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax Act, including NPOs \nidentified as higher risk2. NPOs that are not defined as a PSC but that have \nprofit-making business must submit financial statements to the competent tax \noffice (art. 60, Corporate Tax Act) and report the inheritance tax, if the \norganisation receives tangible or intangible property (art. 4.2, Inheritance Tax \nand Gift Tax Act). NPOs identified as high risk are now subject to duty of \ndisclosure and subsequent monitoring, as noted under c.8.1(a). However, it is \nnot entirely clear if NPOs that  submit a simpler disclosure form are doing so \nbecause of their asset size alone or if there is consideration of the TF risk. \nKorea has made progress in ensuring that NPOs at risk of TF abuse are subject \nto monitoring and supervision, but gaps remain in the application of risk-\nbased supervision. \nCriterion 8.4 (Partly Met)  \nAs outlined under c.8.3, the 2020 MER found deficiencies regarding the \nmonitoring of higher-risk NPOs in Korea. While the MER notes that many \nNPOs are subject to ongoing and strict scrutiny to prevent misuse of public \nfunds, which indirectly contributes to TF prevention, this does not extend to \nall NPOs identified as high risk (c.8.4(a)). Furthermore, monitoring is focused \non criminal activity rather than compliance with R.8 requirements. The MER \ndid however note that Korea’s monitoring and supervisions systems were \ngenerally consistent with Korea’s risk profile. The efforts undertaken by \n \n2  There are nine organisations that are exempt from reporting requirements, five of which do \nnot meet the definition of NPO under the FATF Standards and four that failed to comply with \ndisclosure obligations pursuant to Article 50.3 of the Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax Act. In \ncase of failure to comply with this obligation in 2024, they will be required to pay additional \ntax pursuant to Article 78.11 of the Act. \n      | 5 \nKOREA: FOURTH ENHANCED FOLLOW-UP REPORT \n      \nKorea on outreach and guidance through the self-checklist as described under \nc.8.2 are useful tools for improving understanding of TF risks on the part of \nNPOs. However, these efforts do not address the deficiency identified in the \nMER under c.8.4(a), namely that monitoring efforts for compliance continue \nto be secondary compared to monitoring of suspected ML/TF activity. The \ntechnical deficiencies under c.8.4(a) therefore remain. \nRegarding c.8.4(b), as set out in 2020, Korea has some ability to apply \neffective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions for violations of the \nrequirements applicable to NPOs. Registrars can deregister NPOs for breaches \nof their financial reporting obligations (Civil Act, art.38; Act on the \nEstablishment and Operation of Public Interest Corporations, art.16) and the \nNTS can also sanction such breaches by imposing additional tax. While no \nsanctions are available for the NPO’s officers, where a NPO collects donations \noutside its specified collection plan, the NPO or its officer(s) can face \nimprisonment of up to three years or a fine of KRW 30 million (EUR 23 500) \n(Act on Collection and Use of Donations, art.4, 10, 16). The MER deemed the \nrange of sanctions available to be relatively limited, which may reduce Korea’s \nability to impose proportionate sanctions. Korea does not appear to have \nmade new sanctions available for breaches of compliance with R.8 and the \ntechnical shortcomings remain. The deficiencies remain under c.8.4. \nCriterion 8.5 (Met)  \nKorea did not fully meet the requirements of this criterion at the time of the \nMER. While Korea ensures cooperation and coordination between authorities \nwith information on NPOs through the NPOs CFT Agencies Committee, this \ncommittee and other mechanisms did not include all NPO registrars, which \nwas deemed as detrimental to information sharing on NPOs (c.8.5(a)). Since \nthe MER, to promote effective cooperation, coordination, and information \nexchange between related agencies that hold NPO information, the NPO CFT \nAgencies Committee was established under the purview of the KoFIU. \nParticipating agencies include the Office for Government Coordination, \nNational Intelligence Service, Ministry of the Interior and Safety, NTS, National \nPolice Agency, Financial Supervisory Service, and Korea International \nCooperation Agency (KOICA). The consultative group adjourns to discuss \npolicies, inspections, education and outreach programmes and information \nsharing, with a focus on how to protect NPOs from TF abuse. As NPOs are now \ndefined as Public Service Corporations under the Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax \nAct, the NTS is the competent authority that manages and oversees the \nregistration of NPOs in Korea (as of 2022). The NTS takes part in the Council, \nand as such, the deficiency identified under c.8.5(a) has been resolved. \nAs set out in 2020, competent authorities can carry out investigations into \nNPOs suspected of TF abuse (c.8.5(b)), the NPA is able to obtain information \non the administration and management of NPOs through various channels \n(c.8.5(c)) and the NPOs CFT Agencies Committee and Counter-Terrorism \nCommittee provide mechanisms for sharing suspicions of NPO abuse with \nrelevant authorities, including the NPA for investigation. NPO registrars are \naware of the TF risks in the sector, in part due to outreach on this topic, and \nknow to report any suspicions to the NPA (c.8.5(d)). No technical deficiencies \nwere identified regarding c.8.5(b)-(d). Given that the technical shortcoming \nunder c.8.5(a) has been addressed, this criterion is now met.  \n6 |       \nKOREA: FOURTH ENHANCED FOLLOW-UP REPORT \n      \nCriterion 8.6 (Met) \nAs set out in 2020, international requests for information regarding NPOs \nsuspected of TF abuse are dealt with in the same was as any other request for \ninformation. KoFIU, the NPA or other competent authorities can informally \nprovide information as described in R.40 of the MER. Where one agency \nreceives a request for information relevant to another agency, the NPOs CFT \nAgencies Committee provides contact points through which such requests can \nbe shared. Foreign parties may also obtain public financial or administrative \ninformation through GuideStar or the NTS. \nWeighting and conclusion: Korea has taken steps to address the deficiencies identified in \nits 2020 MER. Korea has identified which NPOs fall within the FATF definition and since \n2022, subjected PSCs to duty of disclosure under the Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax Act. These \nPSCs are subject to supervision and monitoring, in line with the risk-based approach. KoFIU \nundertakes reviews of the adequacy of Korea’s measures to prevent TF abuse of at-risk NPOs, \nand the legislative framework is adequate and risk based. Korea periodically reassesses the \nNPO sector to review up-to-date information on its vulnerabilities and the NPOs CFT \nAgencies Committee meets on an ad hoc basis. Korea ensures that NPOs are subject to \nmeasures and obligations that aim to increase transparency and accountability and prevent \nTF and has established policies to promote accountability, integrity and public confidence in \nthe administration of NPOs under the Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax Act. Outreach efforts and \nactivities have been strengthened through roundtable meetings with representative agencies \nfrom the NPO sector with a focus on internationally active NPOs considered at-risk to TF \nabuse. With the participation of representative agencies, Korea has developed checklists that \nallow the NPO sector to self-assess their exposure to potential TF risks and abuse, and all \nNPOs are required to use regulated financial channels and provide information on their \naccounts to the NTS. Korea ensures that there are effective information gathering and \ncoordination mechanisms in place, namely through the NPO CFT Agencies Committee, and \ncompetent authorities can carry out investigations into NPOs suspected of TF abuse. \nInformation is readily available to competent authorities and NPO registrars are aware of the \nTF risks in the sector. KoFIU deals with international requests for information regarding \nNPOs suspected of TF abuse adequately.     \nHowever, some deficiencies remain. While Korea has made efforts to identify the nature of \nTF threats posed to at-risk NPOs, some of the threats identified were very general and \ninformation provided on TF threats and vulnerabilities were largely based on international \nstudies and lacked specificity in the Korean context. Korea has made progress in ensuring \nthat NPOs at risk of TF abuse are subject to monitoring and supervision, but gaps remain in \nthe application of risk-based supervision. Monitoring efforts for compliance continue to be \nsecondary compared to monitoring of suspected ML/TF activity, and while Korea has some \nability to apply effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions for violations of the \nrequirements applicable to NPOs, the range of sanctions available is relatively limited. \nConsidering the progress made and taking into account Korea’s risk and context,  \nRecommendation 8 is re-rated as Largely Compliant. \n \n \n      | 7 \nKOREA: FOURTH ENHANCED FOLLOW-UP REPORT \n      \nConclusion \nOverall, Korea has made progress in addressing technical compliance deficiencies identified \nin its MER and has been re-rated Largely Compliant with R.8.  \nThe table below shows Korea’s MER ratings and reflects the progress it has made, and any \nre-ratings based on this and previous FURs: \nTable 1.

Korea did not request \ntechnical compliance re-ratings in its three previous enhanced Follow Up Reports (FUR) \n(2021-23). This 4th enhanced FUR analyses Korea’s progress in addressing the technical \ncompliance deficiencies identified in its MER, relating to Recommendation 8. A re-rating is \ngiven where sufficient progress has been made. \nOverall, the expectation is that countries will have addressed most, if not all, technical \ncompliance deficiencies by the end of the third year from the adoption of their MER. This \nreport does not address what progress Korea has made to improve its effectiveness.  \nThe following expert, supported by Ms. Lisa Kilduff, Policy Analyst within the FATF \nSecretariat, assessed Korea’s request for technical compliance re-ratings:  \n• \nMr. Ian McDonald, Senior Policy Analyst, Royal Canadian Mounted Police \nfrom Canada. \nThe second section of this report summarises Korea’s progress in improving technical \ncompliance. The third section sets out the conclusion and includes a table showing Korea’s \nMER ratings and updated ratings based on this and previous FURs. \nProgress to improve Technical Compliance \nThis section summarises Korea’s progress to improve its technical compliance by addressing \nsome of the technical compliance deficiencies identified in the MER (R.8). \nProgress to address technical compliance deficiencies identified in the \nMER \nKorea has made progress to address the technical compliance deficiencies identified in the \nMER in relation to R.8. Because of this progress, Korea has been re-rated on this \nRecommendation. \n \n1  www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Mutualevaluations/Mer-korea-2020.html  \n2 |       \nKOREA: FOURTH ENHANCED FOLLOW-UP REPORT \n      \nRecommendation 8  \n \nYear  \nRating \nMER  \n2020 \nPC \nFUR1 \n2021 \nPC (not re-assessed) \nFUR2 \n2022 \nPC (not re-assessed) \nFUR3 \n2023 \nPC (not re-assessed) \nFUR4 \n2024 \n↑LC \nCriterion 8.1 (Mostly Met) \nKorea did not fully meet the requirements of this criterion at the time of the \nMER as it had not clearly identified which registered NPOs fell within the FATF \ndefinition of Non-Profit Organisations (NPO). Furthermore, Korea’s definition \nof ‘public interest corporation’ (PIC) did not strictly align with the FATF \ndefinition (c.8.1(a)). Since its MER, Korea has taken steps to identify which \nNPOs fall within the FATF definition. As of 2022, Korea identified that there \nwas a total of 53 918 Non-Profit Corporations (NPCs) in Korea, which were \nregistered with the National Tax Service (NTS) based on in the Corporate Tax \nAct and the Value-added Act. These NPCs all received their unique \nidentification numbers issued from the competent tax offices. In consultation \nwith the NPO sector, Korea has since imposed the duty of disclosure on NPCs \nto monitor tax evasion, misappropriation of funds and other illicit activities \nand to protect the legitimate activities of NPOs. It has done so by stipulating \nthat a person who conducts business for purposes of public service, related to \nreligion, charity, or academic studies under the Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax \nAct constitutes a Public Service Corporation (PSC). As of 2022, there were a \ntotal of 39,273 PSCs that are subject to disclosure requirements under the \nInheritance Tax and Gift Tax Act (art. 50.3). In general, all PSCs in Korea have \na duty of disclosure to report settlement statements. However, organisations \nthat are determined to be contributing to religious propagation and \nreformation of the people are exempt from this disclosure. As well, small PSCs \nare allowed to make this report through a simple form, to ensure that the \nreporting requirement reflects the risk-based approach being used in Korea. \nKorea has identified 309 internationally active NPOs and 159 NPOs \nconducting religious activities as being at higher risk of TF abuse, and these \nNPOs are subject to the full reporting requirement and cannot qualify for \nsimplified reporting measures. Korea has therefore addressed the deficiency \nidentified in the MER under c.8.1(a). \nWhile the 2020 MER found that Korea had made efforts to identify the nature \nof TF threats posed to at-risk NPOs, some of the threats identified were very \ngeneral and information provided on TF threats and vulnerabilities were \nlargely based on international studies and lacked specificity in the Korean \ncontext (c.8.1(b)). In 2023, Korea undertook an assessment of the risks facing \nthe NPO sector. This was based on analyses of STR statistics, TF crime \ntypologies and interviews with representative agencies from the NPO sector. \nThe assessment concluded that NPOs with an international presence are more \nlikely to be at risk to TF abuse than domestically active NPOs in Korea. The \nstudy resulted in findings and guidance that was issued to representative \nagencies as a result by KoFIU. However, limited information has been \nprovided on the extent to which Korea identifies the nature nature of threats \n      | 3 \nKOREA: FOURTH ENHANCED FOLLOW-UP REPORT \n      \nposed by terrorist entities to the NPOs which are at risk as well as how \nterrorist actors abuse those NPOs. The deficiency under c.8.1(b) has only been \naddressed to some extent and the deficiency remains. \nAs set out in 2020, KoFIU undertakes reviews of the adequacy of Korea’s \nmeasures to prevent TF abuse of at-risk NPOs, and the legislative framework \nwas considered adequate and risk based. No technical shortcomings were \nidentified (c.8.1(c)). Similarly, Korea has periodically reassessed the NPO \nsector to review up-to-date information on its vulnerabilities, the most recent \nof which was undertaken in 2023. The NPOs CFT Agencies Committee meets \non an ad hoc basis to discuss issues as they arise, including new information \non risks and vulnerabilities. No technical shortcomings were identified \n(c.8.1(d)). While Korea has addressed deficiencies under c.8.1(a) and made \nprogress regarding c.8.1(b) to some extent, shortcomings remain under this \nsub-criterion. Criterion 8.1 remains mostly met. \nCriterion 8.2 (Met)  \nKorea did not fully meet the requirements of this criterion at the time of the \nMER due to deficiencies under c.8.2(a)-(c). The MER found that the Guidelines \non Combating TF Abuse of NPOs were not comprehensive, and while certain \nNPOs were subject to measures and obligations that aim to increase \ntransparency \nand \naccountability \nand \nprevent \nTF, \nKorea \nlacked \ncomprehensive policies aimed at promoting accountability, integrity and \npublic confidence for all NPOs (c.8.2(a)). As at the time of the MER, there are \npolicies in place regarding the establishment, control and supervision of PICs \nunder the Act on the Establishment and Operation of Public Interest \nCorporations. As noted under c.8.1, since the MER, Korea has established \npolicies regarding PSCs under the Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax Act, which are \nsubject to reporting requirements and oversight by the NTS. Under the \nInheritance Tax and Gift Tax Act, PSCs are required to: undertake public \nfinancial reporting, including details on collection and disbursement of \ndonations (art. 50.3); apply accounting standards (art. 50.4); keep records \nand preserve significant evidentiary documents for 10 years from the last date \nof a taxable period of income tax or a business year of corporate tax (art. 51), \nand; undergo tax verification and audit (art. 50). Korea has therefore \ndemonstrated that there are policies in place to promote accountability, \nintegrity and public confidence in the administration of NPOs, and the \ndeficiency under c.8.2(a) has been addressed. \nRegarding c.8.2(b), the MER identified shortcomings in Korea’s outreach \nefforts, noting that they did not include certain high-risk NPOs or donor \ncommunities. Since 2020, the Korean government has reinforced its outreach \nactivities to strengthen awareness among NPOs about their potential \nvulnerabilities to TF risks and abuse. Such activities include holding a \nroundtable meeting with three representative agencies from the NPO sector \n(GuideStar, KCOC, KCMS), with a focus on internationally active NPOs \nconsidered at-risk to TF abuse and working alongside NPOs to develop \neducational materials on the subject. The technical shortcomings have \ntherefore been addressed under c.8.2(b).  \nWhile the KoFIU Guidelines on Combatting TF Abuse of NPOs include best \npractices for addressing TF risks and vulnerabilities, the MER noted a minor \n4 |       \nKOREA: FOURTH ENHANCED FOLLOW-UP REPORT \n      \ndeficiency regarding the lack of NPO input into the development or \nrefinement of the guidelines (c.8.2(c)). Since the MER, in addition to the \nguidelines, Korea has developed checklists that allow the NPO sector to self-\nassess their exposure to potential TF risks and abuse, which can be filtered by \nregulation, area of activity and risk level. The three representative agencies \n(GuideStar, KCOC, KCMS) participated in the development of said checklists, \nwhich have been distributed to at-risk NPOs. Considering this progress, the \ntechnical deficiencies under c.8.2(c) have been addressed. \nAs set out in 2020, all NPOs are required to use regulated financial channels \nand provide information on their accounts to the NTS (Inheritance Tax and \nGift Tax Act, art.50-2). Development aid NPOs are also subject to additional \nrequirements to conduct transactions through certified bank accounts or \nregulated financial channels (Korea International Cooperation Agency Act, \nart.22-2). No technical deficiencies were identified (c.8.2(d)). Considering the \nprogress made under c.8.2(a)-(c), this criterion is now considered met. \nCriterion 8.3 (Mostly Met)  \nThe 2020 MER found that while Korea had some measures in place to promote \nsupervision and monitoring of NPOs and demonstrate that the measures \napplied to NPOs were risk-based, half of the country’s higher-risk NPO \npopulation were not subject to adequate reporting or disclosure \nrequirements. As noted under c.8.1, PSCs are now subject to reporting \nrequirements under the Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax Act, including NPOs \nidentified as higher risk2. NPOs that are not defined as a PSC but that have \nprofit-making business must submit financial statements to the competent tax \noffice (art. 60, Corporate Tax Act) and report the inheritance tax, if the \norganisation receives tangible or intangible property (art. 4.2, Inheritance Tax \nand Gift Tax Act). NPOs identified as high risk are now subject to duty of \ndisclosure and subsequent monitoring, as noted under c.8.1(a). However, it is \nnot entirely clear if NPOs that  submit a simpler disclosure form are doing so \nbecause of their asset size alone or if there is consideration of the TF risk. \nKorea has made progress in ensuring that NPOs at risk of TF abuse are subject \nto monitoring and supervision, but gaps remain in the application of risk-\nbased supervision. \nCriterion 8.4 (Partly Met)  \nAs outlined under c.8.3, the 2020 MER found deficiencies regarding the \nmonitoring of higher-risk NPOs in Korea. While the MER notes that many \nNPOs are subject to ongoing and strict scrutiny to prevent misuse of public \nfunds, which indirectly contributes to TF prevention, this does not extend to \nall NPOs identified as high risk (c.8.4(a)). Furthermore, monitoring is focused \non criminal activity rather than compliance with R.8 requirements. The MER \ndid however note that Korea’s monitoring and supervisions systems were \ngenerally consistent with Korea’s risk profile. The efforts undertaken by \n \n2  There are nine organisations that are exempt from reporting requirements, five of which do \nnot meet the definition of NPO under the FATF Standards and four that failed to comply with \ndisclosure obligations pursuant to Article 50.3 of the Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax Act. In \ncase of failure to comply with this obligation in 2024, they will be required to pay additional \ntax pursuant to Article 78.11 of the Act. \n      | 5 \nKOREA: FOURTH ENHANCED FOLLOW-UP REPORT \n      \nKorea on outreach and guidance through the self-checklist as described under \nc.8.2 are useful tools for improving understanding of TF risks on the part of \nNPOs. However, these efforts do not address the deficiency identified in the \nMER under c.8.4(a), namely that monitoring efforts for compliance continue \nto be secondary compared to monitoring of suspected ML/TF activity. The \ntechnical deficiencies under c.8.4(a) therefore remain. \nRegarding c.8.4(b), as set out in 2020, Korea has some ability to apply \neffective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions for violations of the \nrequirements applicable to NPOs. Registrars can deregister NPOs for breaches \nof their financial reporting obligations (Civil Act, art.38; Act on the \nEstablishment and Operation of Public Interest Corporations, art.16) and the \nNTS can also sanction such breaches by imposing additional tax. While no \nsanctions are available for the NPO’s officers, where a NPO collects donations \noutside its specified collection plan, the NPO or its officer(s) can face \nimprisonment of up to three years or a fine of KRW 30 million (EUR 23 500) \n(Act on Collection and Use of Donations, art.4, 10, 16). The MER deemed the \nrange of sanctions available to be relatively limited, which may reduce Korea’s \nability to impose proportionate sanctions. Korea does not appear to have \nmade new sanctions available for breaches of compliance with R.8 and the \ntechnical shortcomings remain. The deficiencies remain under c.8.4. \nCriterion 8.5 (Met)  \nKorea did not fully meet the requirements of this criterion at the time of the \nMER. While Korea ensures cooperation and coordination between authorities \nwith information on NPOs through the NPOs CFT Agencies Committee, this \ncommittee and other mechanisms did not include all NPO registrars, which \nwas deemed as detrimental to information sharing on NPOs (c.8.5(a)). Since \nthe MER, to promote effective cooperation, coordination, and information \nexchange between related agencies that hold NPO information, the NPO CFT \nAgencies Committee was established under the purview of the KoFIU. \nParticipating agencies include the Office for Government Coordination, \nNational Intelligence Service, Ministry of the Interior and Safety, NTS, National \nPolice Agency, Financial Supervisory Service, and Korea International \nCooperation Agency (KOICA). The consultative group adjourns to discuss \npolicies, inspections, education and outreach programmes and information \nsharing, with a focus on how to protect NPOs from TF abuse. As NPOs are now \ndefined as Public Service Corporations under the Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax \nAct, the NTS is the competent authority that manages and oversees the \nregistration of NPOs in Korea (as of 2022). The NTS takes part in the Council, \nand as such, the deficiency identified under c.8.5(a) has been resolved. \nAs set out in 2020, competent authorities can carry out investigations into \nNPOs suspected of TF abuse (c.8.5(b)), the NPA is able to obtain information \non the administration and management of NPOs through various channels \n(c.8.5(c)) and the NPOs CFT Agencies Committee and Counter-Terrorism \nCommittee provide mechanisms for sharing suspicions of NPO abuse with \nrelevant authorities, including the NPA for investigation. NPO registrars are \naware of the TF risks in the sector, in part due to outreach on this topic, and \nknow to report any suspicions to the NPA (c.8.5(d)). No technical deficiencies \nwere identified regarding c.8.5(b)-(d). Given that the technical shortcoming \nunder c.8.5(a) has been addressed, this criterion is now met.  \n6 |       \nKOREA: FOURTH ENHANCED FOLLOW-UP REPORT \n      \nCriterion 8.6 (Met) \nAs set out in 2020, international requests for information regarding NPOs \nsuspected of TF abuse are dealt with in the same was as any other request for \ninformation. KoFIU, the NPA or other competent authorities can informally \nprovide information as described in R.40 of the MER. Where one agency \nreceives a request for information relevant to another agency, the NPOs CFT \nAgencies Committee provides contact points through which such requests can \nbe shared. Foreign parties may also obtain public financial or administrative \ninformation through GuideStar or the NTS. \nWeighting and conclusion: Korea has taken steps to address the deficiencies identified in \nits 2020 MER. Korea has identified which NPOs fall within the FATF definition and since \n2022, subjected PSCs to duty of disclosure under the Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax Act. These \nPSCs are subject to supervision and monitoring, in line with the risk-based approach. KoFIU \nundertakes reviews of the adequacy of Korea’s measures to prevent TF abuse of at-risk NPOs, \nand the legislative framework is adequate and risk based. Korea periodically reassesses the \nNPO sector to review up-to-date information on its vulnerabilities and the NPOs CFT \nAgencies Committee meets on an ad hoc basis. Korea ensures that NPOs are subject to \nmeasures and obligations that aim to increase transparency and accountability and prevent \nTF and has established policies to promote accountability, integrity and public confidence in \nthe administration of NPOs under the Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax Act. Outreach efforts and \nactivities have been strengthened through roundtable meetings with representative agencies \nfrom the NPO sector with a focus on internationally active NPOs considered at-risk to TF \nabuse. With the participation of representative agencies, Korea has developed checklists that \nallow the NPO sector to self-assess their exposure to potential TF risks and abuse, and all \nNPOs are required to use regulated financial channels and provide information on their \naccounts to the NTS. Korea ensures that there are effective information gathering and \ncoordination mechanisms in place, namely through the NPO CFT Agencies Committee, and \ncompetent authorities can carry out investigations into NPOs suspected of TF abuse. \nInformation is readily available to competent authorities and NPO registrars are aware of the \nTF risks in the sector. KoFIU deals with international requests for information regarding \nNPOs suspected of TF abuse adequately.     \nHowever, some deficiencies remain. While Korea has made efforts to identify the nature of \nTF threats posed to at-risk NPOs, some of the threats identified were very general and \ninformation provided on TF threats and vulnerabilities were largely based on international \nstudies and lacked specificity in the Korean context. Korea has made progress in ensuring \nthat NPOs at risk of TF abuse are subject to monitoring and supervision, but gaps remain in \nthe application of risk-based supervision. Monitoring efforts for compliance continue to be \nsecondary compared to monitoring of suspected ML/TF activity, and while Korea has some \nability to apply effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions for violations of the \nrequirements applicable to NPOs, the range of sanctions available is relatively limited. \nConsidering the progress made and taking into account Korea’s risk and context,  \nRecommendation 8 is re-rated as Largely Compliant. \n \n \n      | 7 \nKOREA: FOURTH ENHANCED FOLLOW-UP REPORT \n      \nConclusion \nOverall, Korea has made progress in addressing technical compliance deficiencies identified \nin its MER and has been re-rated Largely Compliant with R.8.  \nThe table below shows Korea’s MER ratings and reflects the progress it has made, and any \nre-ratings based on this and previous FURs: \nTable 1.

Korea did not request \ntechnical compliance re-ratings in its three previous enhanced Follow Up Reports (FUR) \n(2021-23). This 4th enhanced FUR analyses Korea’s progress in addressing the technical \ncompliance deficiencies identified in its MER, relating to Recommendation 8. A re-rating is \ngiven where sufficient progress has been made. \nOverall, the expectation is that countries will have addressed most, if not all, technical \ncompliance deficiencies by the end of the third year from the adoption of their MER. This \nreport does not address what progress Korea has made to improve its effectiveness.  \nThe following expert, supported by Ms. Lisa Kilduff, Policy Analyst within the FATF \nSecretariat, assessed Korea’s request for technical compliance re-ratings:  \n• \nMr. Ian McDonald, Senior Policy Analyst, Royal Canadian Mounted Police \nfrom Canada. \nThe second section of this report summarises Korea’s progress in improving technical \ncompliance. The third section sets out the conclusion and includes a table showing Korea’s \nMER ratings and updated ratings based on this and previous FURs. \nProgress to improve Technical Compliance \nThis section summarises Korea’s progress to improve its technical compliance by addressing \nsome of the technical compliance deficiencies identified in the MER (R.8). \nProgress to address technical compliance deficiencies identified in the \nMER \nKorea has made progress to address the technical compliance deficiencies identified in the \nMER in relation to R.8. Because of this progress, Korea has been re-rated on this \nRecommendation. \n \n1  www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Mutualevaluations/Mer-korea-2020.html  \n2 |       \nKOREA: FOURTH ENHANCED FOLLOW-UP REPORT \n      \nRecommendation 8  \n \nYear  \nRating \nMER  \n2020 \nPC \nFUR1 \n2021 \nPC (not re-assessed) \nFUR2 \n2022 \nPC (not re-assessed) \nFUR3 \n2023 \nPC (not re-assessed) \nFUR4 \n2024 \n↑LC \nCriterion 8.1 (Mostly Met) \nKorea did not fully meet the requirements of this criterion at the time of the \nMER as it had not clearly identified which registered NPOs fell within the FATF \ndefinition of Non-Profit Organisations (NPO). Furthermore, Korea’s definition \nof ‘public interest corporation’ (PIC) did not strictly align with the FATF \ndefinition (c.8.1(a)). Since its MER, Korea has taken steps to identify which \nNPOs fall within the FATF definition. As of 2022, Korea identified that there \nwas a total of 53 918 Non-Profit Corporations (NPCs) in Korea, which were \nregistered with the National Tax Service (NTS) based on in the Corporate Tax \nAct and the Value-added Act. These NPCs all received their unique \nidentification numbers issued from the competent tax offices. In consultation \nwith the NPO sector, Korea has since imposed the duty of disclosure on NPCs \nto monitor tax evasion, misappropriation of funds and other illicit activities \nand to protect the legitimate activities of NPOs. It has done so by stipulating \nthat a person who conducts business for purposes of public service, related to \nreligion, charity, or academic studies under the Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax \nAct constitutes a Public Service Corporation (PSC). As of 2022, there were a \ntotal of 39,273 PSCs that are subject to disclosure requirements under the \nInheritance Tax and Gift Tax Act (art. 50.3). In general, all PSCs in Korea have \na duty of disclosure to report settlement statements. However, organisations \nthat are determined to be contributing to religious propagation and \nreformation of the people are exempt from this disclosure. As well, small PSCs \nare allowed to make this report through a simple form, to ensure that the \nreporting requirement reflects the risk-based approach being used in Korea. \nKorea has identified 309 internationally active NPOs and 159 NPOs \nconducting religious activities as being at higher risk of TF abuse, and these \nNPOs are subject to the full reporting requirement and cannot qualify for \nsimplified reporting measures. Korea has therefore addressed the deficiency \nidentified in the MER under c.8.1(a). \nWhile the 2020 MER found that Korea had made efforts to identify the nature \nof TF threats posed to at-risk NPOs, some of the threats identified were very \ngeneral and information provided on TF threats and vulnerabilities were \nlargely based on international studies and lacked specificity in the Korean \ncontext (c.8.1(b)). In 2023, Korea undertook an assessment of the risks facing \nthe NPO sector. This was based on analyses of STR statistics, TF crime \ntypologies and interviews with representative agencies from the NPO sector. \nThe assessment concluded that NPOs with an international presence are more \nlikely to be at risk to TF abuse than domestically active NPOs in Korea. The \nstudy resulted in findings and guidance that was issued to representative \nagencies as a result by KoFIU. However, limited information has been \nprovided on the extent to which Korea identifies the nature nature of threats \n      | 3 \nKOREA: FOURTH ENHANCED FOLLOW-UP REPORT \n      \nposed by terrorist entities to the NPOs which are at risk as well as how \nterrorist actors abuse those NPOs. The deficiency under c.8.1(b) has only been \naddressed to some extent and the deficiency remains. \nAs set out in 2020, KoFIU undertakes reviews of the adequacy of Korea’s \nmeasures to prevent TF abuse of at-risk NPOs, and the legislative framework \nwas considered adequate and risk based. No technical shortcomings were \nidentified (c.8.1(c)). Similarly, Korea has periodically reassessed the NPO \nsector to review up-to-date information on its vulnerabilities, the most recent \nof which was undertaken in 2023. The NPOs CFT Agencies Committee meets \non an ad hoc basis to discuss issues as they arise, including new information \non risks and vulnerabilities. No technical shortcomings were identified \n(c.8.1(d)). While Korea has addressed deficiencies under c.8.1(a) and made \nprogress regarding c.8.1(b) to some extent, shortcomings remain under this \nsub-criterion. Criterion 8.1 remains mostly met. \nCriterion 8.2 (Met)  \nKorea did not fully meet the requirements of this criterion at the time of the \nMER due to deficiencies under c.8.2(a)-(c). The MER found that the Guidelines \non Combating TF Abuse of NPOs were not comprehensive, and while certain \nNPOs were subject to measures and obligations that aim to increase \ntransparency \nand \naccountability \nand \nprevent \nTF, \nKorea \nlacked \ncomprehensive policies aimed at promoting accountability, integrity and \npublic confidence for all NPOs (c.8.2(a)). As at the time of the MER, there are \npolicies in place regarding the establishment, control and supervision of PICs \nunder the Act on the Establishment and Operation of Public Interest \nCorporations. As noted under c.8.1, since the MER, Korea has established \npolicies regarding PSCs under the Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax Act, which are \nsubject to reporting requirements and oversight by the NTS. Under the \nInheritance Tax and Gift Tax Act, PSCs are required to: undertake public \nfinancial reporting, including details on collection and disbursement of \ndonations (art. 50.3); apply accounting standards (art. 50.4); keep records \nand preserve significant evidentiary documents for 10 years from the last date \nof a taxable period of income tax or a business year of corporate tax (art. 51), \nand; undergo tax verification and audit (art. 50). Korea has therefore \ndemonstrated that there are policies in place to promote accountability, \nintegrity and public confidence in the administration of NPOs, and the \ndeficiency under c.8.2(a) has been addressed. \nRegarding c.8.2(b), the MER identified shortcomings in Korea’s outreach \nefforts, noting that they did not include certain high-risk NPOs or donor \ncommunities. Since 2020, the Korean government has reinforced its outreach \nactivities to strengthen awareness among NPOs about their potential \nvulnerabilities to TF risks and abuse. Such activities include holding a \nroundtable meeting with three representative agencies from the NPO sector \n(GuideStar, KCOC, KCMS), with a focus on internationally active NPOs \nconsidered at-risk to TF abuse and working alongside NPOs to develop \neducational materials on the subject. The technical shortcomings have \ntherefore been addressed under c.8.2(b).  \nWhile the KoFIU Guidelines on Combatting TF Abuse of NPOs include best \npractices for addressing TF risks and vulnerabilities, the MER noted a minor \n4 |       \nKOREA: FOURTH ENHANCED FOLLOW-UP REPORT \n      \ndeficiency regarding the lack of NPO input into the development or \nrefinement of the guidelines (c.8.2(c)). Since the MER, in addition to the \nguidelines, Korea has developed checklists that allow the NPO sector to self-\nassess their exposure to potential TF risks and abuse, which can be filtered by \nregulation, area of activity and risk level. The three representative agencies \n(GuideStar, KCOC, KCMS) participated in the development of said checklists, \nwhich have been distributed to at-risk NPOs. Considering this progress, the \ntechnical deficiencies under c.8.2(c) have been addressed. \nAs set out in 2020, all NPOs are required to use regulated financial channels \nand provide information on their accounts to the NTS (Inheritance Tax and \nGift Tax Act, art.50-2). Development aid NPOs are also subject to additional \nrequirements to conduct transactions through certified bank accounts or \nregulated financial channels (Korea International Cooperation Agency Act, \nart.22-2). No technical deficiencies were identified (c.8.2(d)). Considering the \nprogress made under c.8.2(a)-(c), this criterion is now considered met. \nCriterion 8.3 (Mostly Met)  \nThe 2020 MER found that while Korea had some measures in place to promote \nsupervision and monitoring of NPOs and demonstrate that the measures \napplied to NPOs were risk-based, half of the country’s higher-risk NPO \npopulation were not subject to adequate reporting or disclosure \nrequirements. As noted under c.8.1, PSCs are now subject to reporting \nrequirements under the Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax Act, including NPOs \nidentified as higher risk2. NPOs that are not defined as a PSC but that have \nprofit-making business must submit financial statements to the competent tax \noffice (art. 60, Corporate Tax Act) and report the inheritance tax, if the \norganisation receives tangible or intangible property (art. 4.2, Inheritance Tax \nand Gift Tax Act). NPOs identified as high risk are now subject to duty of \ndisclosure and subsequent monitoring, as noted under c.8.1(a). However, it is \nnot entirely clear if NPOs that  submit a simpler disclosure form are doing so \nbecause of their asset size alone or if there is consideration of the TF risk. \nKorea has made progress in ensuring that NPOs at risk of TF abuse are subject \nto monitoring and supervision, but gaps remain in the application of risk-\nbased supervision. \nCriterion 8.4 (Partly Met)  \nAs outlined under c.8.3, the 2020 MER found deficiencies regarding the \nmonitoring of higher-risk NPOs in Korea. While the MER notes that many \nNPOs are subject to ongoing and strict scrutiny to prevent misuse of public \nfunds, which indirectly contributes to TF prevention, this does not extend to \nall NPOs identified as high risk (c.8.4(a)). Furthermore, monitoring is focused \non criminal activity rather than compliance with R.8 requirements. The MER \ndid however note that Korea’s monitoring and supervisions systems were \ngenerally consistent with Korea’s risk profile. The efforts undertaken by \n \n2  There are nine organisations that are exempt from reporting requirements, five of which do \nnot meet the definition of NPO under the FATF Standards and four that failed to comply with \ndisclosure obligations pursuant to Article 50.3 of the Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax Act. In \ncase of failure to comply with this obligation in 2024, they will be required to pay additional \ntax pursuant to Article 78.11 of the Act. \n      | 5 \nKOREA: FOURTH ENHANCED FOLLOW-UP REPORT \n      \nKorea on outreach and guidance through the self-checklist as described under \nc.8.2 are useful tools for improving understanding of TF risks on the part of \nNPOs. However, these efforts do not address the deficiency identified in the \nMER under c.8.4(a), namely that monitoring efforts for compliance continue \nto be secondary compared to monitoring of suspected ML/TF activity. The \ntechnical deficiencies under c.8.4(a) therefore remain. \nRegarding c.8.4(b), as set out in 2020, Korea has some ability to apply \neffective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions for violations of the \nrequirements applicable to NPOs. Registrars can deregister NPOs for breaches \nof their financial reporting obligations (Civil Act, art.38; Act on the \nEstablishment and Operation of Public Interest Corporations, art.16) and the \nNTS can also sanction such breaches by imposing additional tax. While no \nsanctions are available for the NPO’s officers, where a NPO collects donations \noutside its specified collection plan, the NPO or its officer(s) can face \nimprisonment of up to three years or a fine of KRW 30 million (EUR 23 500) \n(Act on Collection and Use of Donations, art.4, 10, 16). The MER deemed the \nrange of sanctions available to be relatively limited, which may reduce Korea’s \nability to impose proportionate sanctions. Korea does not appear to have \nmade new sanctions available for breaches of compliance with R.8 and the \ntechnical shortcomings remain. The deficiencies remain under c.8.4. \nCriterion 8.5 (Met)  \nKorea did not fully meet the requirements of this criterion at the time of the \nMER. While Korea ensures cooperation and coordination between authorities \nwith information on NPOs through the NPOs CFT Agencies Committee, this \ncommittee and other mechanisms did not include all NPO registrars, which \nwas deemed as detrimental to information sharing on NPOs (c.8.5(a)). Since \nthe MER, to promote effective cooperation, coordination, and information \nexchange between related agencies that hold NPO information, the NPO CFT \nAgencies Committee was established under the purview of the KoFIU. \nParticipating agencies include the Office for Government Coordination, \nNational Intelligence Service, Ministry of the Interior and Safety, NTS, National \nPolice Agency, Financial Supervisory Service, and Korea International \nCooperation Agency (KOICA). The consultative group adjourns to discuss \npolicies, inspections, education and outreach programmes and information \nsharing, with a focus on how to protect NPOs from TF abuse. As NPOs are now \ndefined as Public Service Corporations under the Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax \nAct, the NTS is the competent authority that manages and oversees the \nregistration of NPOs in Korea (as of 2022). The NTS takes part in the Council, \nand as such, the deficiency identified under c.8.5(a) has been resolved. \nAs set out in 2020, competent authorities can carry out investigations into \nNPOs suspected of TF abuse (c.8.5(b)), the NPA is able to obtain information \non the administration and management of NPOs through various channels \n(c.8.5(c)) and the NPOs CFT Agencies Committee and Counter-Terrorism \nCommittee provide mechanisms for sharing suspicions of NPO abuse with \nrelevant authorities, including the NPA for investigation. NPO registrars are \naware of the TF risks in the sector, in part due to outreach on this topic, and \nknow to report any suspicions to the NPA (c.8.5(d)). No technical deficiencies \nwere identified regarding c.8.5(b)-(d). Given that the technical shortcoming \nunder c.8.5(a) has been addressed, this criterion is now met.  \n6 |       \nKOREA: FOURTH ENHANCED FOLLOW-UP REPORT \n      \nCriterion 8.6 (Met) \nAs set out in 2020, international requests for information regarding NPOs \nsuspected of TF abuse are dealt with in the same was as any other request for \ninformation. KoFIU, the NPA or other competent authorities can informally \nprovide information as described in R.40 of the MER. Where one agency \nreceives a request for information relevant to another agency, the NPOs CFT \nAgencies Committee provides contact points through which such requests can \nbe shared. Foreign parties may also obtain public financial or administrative \ninformation through GuideStar or the NTS. \nWeighting and conclusion: Korea has taken steps to address the deficiencies identified in \nits 2020 MER. Korea has identified which NPOs fall within the FATF definition and since \n2022, subjected PSCs to duty of disclosure under the Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax Act. These \nPSCs are subject to supervision and monitoring, in line with the risk-based approach. KoFIU \nundertakes reviews of the adequacy of Korea’s measures to prevent TF abuse of at-risk NPOs, \nand the legislative framework is adequate and risk based. Korea periodically reassesses the \nNPO sector to review up-to-date information on its vulnerabilities and the NPOs CFT \nAgencies Committee meets on an ad hoc basis. Korea ensures that NPOs are subject to \nmeasures and obligations that aim to increase transparency and accountability and prevent \nTF and has established policies to promote accountability, integrity and public confidence in \nthe administration of NPOs under the Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax Act. Outreach efforts and \nactivities have been strengthened through roundtable meetings with representative agencies \nfrom the NPO sector with a focus on internationally active NPOs considered at-risk to TF \nabuse. With the participation of representative agencies, Korea has developed checklists that \nallow the NPO sector to self-assess their exposure to potential TF risks and abuse, and all \nNPOs are required to use regulated financial channels and provide information on their \naccounts to the NTS. Korea ensures that there are effective information gathering and \ncoordination mechanisms in place, namely through the NPO CFT Agencies Committee, and \ncompetent authorities can carry out investigations into NPOs suspected of TF abuse. \nInformation is readily available to competent authorities and NPO registrars are aware of the \nTF risks in the sector. KoFIU deals with international requests for information regarding \nNPOs suspected of TF abuse adequately.     \nHowever, some deficiencies remain. While Korea has made efforts to identify the nature of \nTF threats posed to at-risk NPOs, some of the threats identified were very general and \ninformation provided on TF threats and vulnerabilities were largely based on international \nstudies and lacked specificity in the Korean context. Korea has made progress in ensuring \nthat NPOs at risk of TF abuse are subject to monitoring and supervision, but gaps remain in \nthe application of risk-based supervision. Monitoring efforts for compliance continue to be \nsecondary compared to monitoring of suspected ML/TF activity, and while Korea has some \nability to apply effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions for violations of the \nrequirements applicable to NPOs, the range of sanctions available is relatively limited. \nConsidering the progress made and taking into account Korea’s risk and context,  \nRecommendation 8 is re-rated as Largely Compliant. \n \n \n      | 7 \nKOREA: FOURTH ENHANCED FOLLOW-UP REPORT \n      \nConclusion \nOverall, Korea has made progress in addressing technical compliance deficiencies identified \nin its MER and has been re-rated Largely Compliant with R.8.  \nThe table below shows Korea’s MER ratings and reflects the progress it has made, and any \nre-ratings based on this and previous FURs: \nTable 1.

Korea did not request \ntechnical compliance re-ratings in its three previous enhanced Follow Up Reports (FUR) \n(2021-23). This 4th enhanced FUR analyses Korea’s progress in addressing the technical \ncompliance deficiencies identified in its MER, relating to Recommendation 8. A re-rating is \ngiven where sufficient progress has been made. \nOverall, the expectation is that countries will have addressed most, if not all, technical \ncompliance deficiencies by the end of the third year from the adoption of their MER. This \nreport does not address what progress Korea has made to improve its effectiveness.  \nThe following expert, supported by Ms. Lisa Kilduff, Policy Analyst within the FATF \nSecretariat, assessed Korea’s request for technical compliance re-ratings:  \n• \nMr. Ian McDonald, Senior Policy Analyst, Royal Canadian Mounted Police \nfrom Canada. \nThe second section of this report summarises Korea’s progress in improving technical \ncompliance. The third section sets out the conclusion and includes a table showing Korea’s \nMER ratings and updated ratings based on this and previous FURs. \nProgress to improve Technical Compliance \nThis section summarises Korea’s progress to improve its technical compliance by addressing \nsome of the technical compliance deficiencies identified in the MER (R.8). \nProgress to address technical compliance deficiencies identified in the \nMER \nKorea has made progress to address the technical compliance deficiencies identified in the \nMER in relation to R.8. Because of this progress, Korea has been re-rated on this \nRecommendation. \n \n1  www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Mutualevaluations/Mer-korea-2020.html  \n2 |       \nKOREA: FOURTH ENHANCED FOLLOW-UP REPORT \n      \nRecommendation 8  \n \nYear  \nRating \nMER  \n2020 \nPC \nFUR1 \n2021 \nPC (not re-assessed) \nFUR2 \n2022 \nPC (not re-assessed) \nFUR3 \n2023 \nPC (not re-assessed) \nFUR4 \n2024 \n↑LC \nCriterion 8.1 (Mostly Met) \nKorea did not fully meet the requirements of this criterion at the time of the \nMER as it had not clearly identified which registered NPOs fell within the FATF \ndefinition of Non-Profit Organisations (NPO). Furthermore, Korea’s definition \nof ‘public interest corporation’ (PIC) did not strictly align with the FATF \ndefinition (c.8.1(a)). Since its MER, Korea has taken steps to identify which \nNPOs fall within the FATF definition. As of 2022, Korea identified that there \nwas a total of 53 918 Non-Profit Corporations (NPCs) in Korea, which were \nregistered with the National Tax Service (NTS) based on in the Corporate Tax \nAct and the Value-added Act. These NPCs all received their unique \nidentification numbers issued from the competent tax offices. In consultation \nwith the NPO sector, Korea has since imposed the duty of disclosure on NPCs \nto monitor tax evasion, misappropriation of funds and other illicit activities \nand to protect the legitimate activities of NPOs. It has done so by stipulating \nthat a person who conducts business for purposes of public service, related to \nreligion, charity, or academic studies under the Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax \nAct constitutes a Public Service Corporation (PSC). As of 2022, there were a \ntotal of 39,273 PSCs that are subject to disclosure requirements under the \nInheritance Tax and Gift Tax Act (art. 50.3). In general, all PSCs in Korea have \na duty of disclosure to report settlement statements. However, organisations \nthat are determined to be contributing to religious propagation and \nreformation of the people are exempt from this disclosure. As well, small PSCs \nare allowed to make this report through a simple form, to ensure that the \nreporting requirement reflects the risk-based approach being used in Korea. \nKorea has identified 309 internationally active NPOs and 159 NPOs \nconducting religious activities as being at higher risk of TF abuse, and these \nNPOs are subject to the full reporting requirement and cannot qualify for \nsimplified reporting measures. Korea has therefore addressed the deficiency \nidentified in the MER under c.8.1(a). \nWhile the 2020 MER found that Korea had made efforts to identify the nature \nof TF threats posed to at-risk NPOs, some of the threats identified were very \ngeneral and information provided on TF threats and vulnerabilities were \nlargely based on international studies and lacked specificity in the Korean \ncontext (c.8.1(b)). In 2023, Korea undertook an assessment of the risks facing \nthe NPO sector. This was based on analyses of STR statistics, TF crime \ntypologies and interviews with representative agencies from the NPO sector. \nThe assessment concluded that NPOs with an international presence are more \nlikely to be at risk to TF abuse than domestically active NPOs in Korea. The \nstudy resulted in findings and guidance that was issued to representative \nagencies as a result by KoFIU. However, limited information has been \nprovided on the extent to which Korea identifies the nature nature of threats \n      | 3 \nKOREA: FOURTH ENHANCED FOLLOW-UP REPORT \n      \nposed by terrorist entities to the NPOs which are at risk as well as how \nterrorist actors abuse those NPOs. The deficiency under c.8.1(b) has only been \naddressed to some extent and the deficiency remains. \nAs set out in 2020, KoFIU undertakes reviews of the adequacy of Korea’s \nmeasures to prevent TF abuse of at-risk NPOs, and the legislative framework \nwas considered adequate and risk based. No technical shortcomings were \nidentified (c.8.1(c)). Similarly, Korea has periodically reassessed the NPO \nsector to review up-to-date information on its vulnerabilities, the most recent \nof which was undertaken in 2023. The NPOs CFT Agencies Committee meets \non an ad hoc basis to discuss issues as they arise, including new information \non risks and vulnerabilities. No technical shortcomings were identified \n(c.8.1(d)). While Korea has addressed deficiencies under c.8.1(a) and made \nprogress regarding c.8.1(b) to some extent, shortcomings remain under this \nsub-criterion. Criterion 8.1 remains mostly met. \nCriterion 8.2 (Met)  \nKorea did not fully meet the requirements of this criterion at the time of the \nMER due to deficiencies under c.8.2(a)-(c). The MER found that the Guidelines \non Combating TF Abuse of NPOs were not comprehensive, and while certain \nNPOs were subject to measures and obligations that aim to increase \ntransparency \nand \naccountability \nand \nprevent \nTF, \nKorea \nlacked \ncomprehensive policies aimed at promoting accountability, integrity and \npublic confidence for all NPOs (c.8.2(a)). As at the time of the MER, there are \npolicies in place regarding the establishment, control and supervision of PICs \nunder the Act on the Establishment and Operation of Public Interest \nCorporations. As noted under c.8.1, since the MER, Korea has established \npolicies regarding PSCs under the Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax Act, which are \nsubject to reporting requirements and oversight by the NTS. Under the \nInheritance Tax and Gift Tax Act, PSCs are required to: undertake public \nfinancial reporting, including details on collection and disbursement of \ndonations (art. 50.3); apply accounting standards (art. 50.4); keep records \nand preserve significant evidentiary documents for 10 years from the last date \nof a taxable period of income tax or a business year of corporate tax (art. 51), \nand; undergo tax verification and audit (art. 50). Korea has therefore \ndemonstrated that there are policies in place to promote accountability, \nintegrity and public confidence in the administration of NPOs, and the \ndeficiency under c.8.2(a) has been addressed. \nRegarding c.8.2(b), the MER identified shortcomings in Korea’s outreach \nefforts, noting that they did not include certain high-risk NPOs or donor \ncommunities. Since 2020, the Korean government has reinforced its outreach \nactivities to strengthen awareness among NPOs about their potential \nvulnerabilities to TF risks and abuse. Such activities include holding a \nroundtable meeting with three representative agencies from the NPO sector \n(GuideStar, KCOC, KCMS), with a focus on internationally active NPOs \nconsidered at-risk to TF abuse and working alongside NPOs to develop \neducational materials on the subject. The technical shortcomings have \ntherefore been addressed under c.8.2(b).  \nWhile the KoFIU Guidelines on Combatting TF Abuse of NPOs include best \npractices for addressing TF risks and vulnerabilities, the MER noted a minor \n4 |       \nKOREA: FOURTH ENHANCED FOLLOW-UP REPORT \n      \ndeficiency regarding the lack of NPO input into the development or \nrefinement of the guidelines (c.8.2(c)). Since the MER, in addition to the \nguidelines, Korea has developed checklists that allow the NPO sector to self-\nassess their exposure to potential TF risks and abuse, which can be filtered by \nregulation, area of activity and risk level. The three representative agencies \n(GuideStar, KCOC, KCMS) participated in the development of said checklists, \nwhich have been distributed to at-risk NPOs. Considering this progress, the \ntechnical deficiencies under c.8.2(c) have been addressed. \nAs set out in 2020, all NPOs are required to use regulated financial channels \nand provide information on their accounts to the NTS (Inheritance Tax and \nGift Tax Act, art.50-2). Development aid NPOs are also subject to additional \nrequirements to conduct transactions through certified bank accounts or \nregulated financial channels (Korea International Cooperation Agency Act, \nart.22-2). No technical deficiencies were identified (c.8.2(d)). Considering the \nprogress made under c.8.2(a)-(c), this criterion is now considered met. \nCriterion 8.3 (Mostly Met)  \nThe 2020 MER found that while Korea had some measures in place to promote \nsupervision and monitoring of NPOs and demonstrate that the measures \napplied to NPOs were risk-based, half of the country’s higher-risk NPO \npopulation were not subject to adequate reporting or disclosure \nrequirements. As noted under c.8.1, PSCs are now subject to reporting \nrequirements under the Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax Act, including NPOs \nidentified as higher risk2. NPOs that are not defined as a PSC but that have \nprofit-making business must submit financial statements to the competent tax \noffice (art. 60, Corporate Tax Act) and report the inheritance tax, if the \norganisation receives tangible or intangible property (art. 4.2, Inheritance Tax \nand Gift Tax Act). NPOs identified as high risk are now subject to duty of \ndisclosure and subsequent monitoring, as noted under c.8.1(a). However, it is \nnot entirely clear if NPOs that  submit a simpler disclosure form are doing so \nbecause of their asset size alone or if there is consideration of the TF risk. \nKorea has made progress in ensuring that NPOs at risk of TF abuse are subject \nto monitoring and supervision, but gaps remain in the application of risk-\nbased supervision. \nCriterion 8.4 (Partly Met)  \nAs outlined under c.8.3, the 2020 MER found deficiencies regarding the \nmonitoring of higher-risk NPOs in Korea. While the MER notes that many \nNPOs are subject to ongoing and strict scrutiny to prevent misuse of public \nfunds, which indirectly contributes to TF prevention, this does not extend to \nall NPOs identified as high risk (c.8.4(a)). Furthermore, monitoring is focused \non criminal activity rather than compliance with R.8 requirements. The MER \ndid however note that Korea’s monitoring and supervisions systems were \ngenerally consistent with Korea’s risk profile. The efforts undertaken by \n \n2  There are nine organisations that are exempt from reporting requirements, five of which do \nnot meet the definition of NPO under the FATF Standards and four that failed to comply with \ndisclosure obligations pursuant to Article 50.3 of the Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax Act. In \ncase of failure to comply with this obligation in 2024, they will be required to pay additional \ntax pursuant to Article 78.11 of the Act. \n      | 5 \nKOREA: FOURTH ENHANCED FOLLOW-UP REPORT \n      \nKorea on outreach and guidance through the self-checklist as described under \nc.8.2 are useful tools for improving understanding of TF risks on the part of \nNPOs. However, these efforts do not address the deficiency identified in the \nMER under c.8.4(a), namely that monitoring efforts for compliance continue \nto be secondary compared to monitoring of suspected ML/TF activity. The \ntechnical deficiencies under c.8.4(a) therefore remain. \nRegarding c.8.4(b), as set out in 2020, Korea has some ability to apply \neffective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions for violations of the \nrequirements applicable to NPOs. Registrars can deregister NPOs for breaches \nof their financial reporting obligations (Civil Act, art.38; Act on the \nEstablishment and Operation of Public Interest Corporations, art.16) and the \nNTS can also sanction such breaches by imposing additional tax. While no \nsanctions are available for the NPO’s officers, where a NPO collects donations \noutside its specified collection plan, the NPO or its officer(s) can face \nimprisonment of up to three years or a fine of KRW 30 million (EUR 23 500) \n(Act on Collection and Use of Donations, art.4, 10, 16). The MER deemed the \nrange of sanctions available to be relatively limited, which may reduce Korea’s \nability to impose proportionate sanctions. Korea does not appear to have \nmade new sanctions available for breaches of compliance with R.8 and the \ntechnical shortcomings remain. The deficiencies remain under c.8.4. \nCriterion 8.5 (Met)  \nKorea did not fully meet the requirements of this criterion at the time of the \nMER. While Korea ensures cooperation and coordination between authorities \nwith information on NPOs through the NPOs CFT Agencies Committee, this \ncommittee and other mechanisms did not include all NPO registrars, which \nwas deemed as detrimental to information sharing on NPOs (c.8.5(a)). Since \nthe MER, to promote effective cooperation, coordination, and information \nexchange between related agencies that hold NPO information, the NPO CFT \nAgencies Committee was established under the purview of the KoFIU. \nParticipating agencies include the Office for Government Coordination, \nNational Intelligence Service, Ministry of the Interior and Safety, NTS, National \nPolice Agency, Financial Supervisory Service, and Korea International \nCooperation Agency (KOICA). The consultative group adjourns to discuss \npolicies, inspections, education and outreach programmes and information \nsharing, with a focus on how to protect NPOs from TF abuse. As NPOs are now \ndefined as Public Service Corporations under the Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax \nAct, the NTS is the competent authority that manages and oversees the \nregistration of NPOs in Korea (as of 2022). The NTS takes part in the Council, \nand as such, the deficiency identified under c.8.5(a) has been resolved. \nAs set out in 2020, competent authorities can carry out investigations into \nNPOs suspected of TF abuse (c.8.5(b)), the NPA is able to obtain information \non the administration and management of NPOs through various channels \n(c.8.5(c)) and the NPOs CFT Agencies Committee and Counter-Terrorism \nCommittee provide mechanisms for sharing suspicions of NPO abuse with \nrelevant authorities, including the NPA for investigation. NPO registrars are \naware of the TF risks in the sector, in part due to outreach on this topic, and \nknow to report any suspicions to the NPA (c.8.5(d)). No technical deficiencies \nwere identified regarding c.8.5(b)-(d). Given that the technical shortcoming \nunder c.8.5(a) has been addressed, this criterion is now met.  \n6 |       \nKOREA: FOURTH ENHANCED FOLLOW-UP REPORT \n      \nCriterion 8.6 (Met) \nAs set out in 2020, international requests for information regarding NPOs \nsuspected of TF abuse are dealt with in the same was as any other request for \ninformation. KoFIU, the NPA or other competent authorities can informally \nprovide information as described in R.40 of the MER. Where one agency \nreceives a request for information relevant to another agency, the NPOs CFT \nAgencies Committee provides contact points through which such requests can \nbe shared. Foreign parties may also obtain public financial or administrative \ninformation through GuideStar or the NTS. \nWeighting and conclusion: Korea has taken steps to address the deficiencies identified in \nits 2020 MER. Korea has identified which NPOs fall within the FATF definition and since \n2022, subjected PSCs to duty of disclosure under the Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax Act. These \nPSCs are subject to supervision and monitoring, in line with the risk-based approach. KoFIU \nundertakes reviews of the adequacy of Korea’s measures to prevent TF abuse of at-risk NPOs, \nand the legislative framework is adequate and risk based. Korea periodically reassesses the \nNPO sector to review up-to-date information on its vulnerabilities and the NPOs CFT \nAgencies Committee meets on an ad hoc basis. Korea ensures that NPOs are subject to \nmeasures and obligations that aim to increase transparency and accountability and prevent \nTF and has established policies to promote accountability, integrity and public confidence in \nthe administration of NPOs under the Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax Act. Outreach efforts and \nactivities have been strengthened through roundtable meetings with representative agencies \nfrom the NPO sector with a focus on internationally active NPOs considered at-risk to TF \nabuse. With the participation of representative agencies, Korea has developed checklists that \nallow the NPO sector to self-assess their exposure to potential TF risks and abuse, and all \nNPOs are required to use regulated financial channels and provide information on their \naccounts to the NTS. Korea ensures that there are effective information gathering and \ncoordination mechanisms in place, namely through the NPO CFT Agencies Committee, and \ncompetent authorities can carry out investigations into NPOs suspected of TF abuse. \nInformation is readily available to competent authorities and NPO registrars are aware of the \nTF risks in the sector. KoFIU deals with international requests for information regarding \nNPOs suspected of TF abuse adequately.     \nHowever, some deficiencies remain. While Korea has made efforts to identify the nature of \nTF threats posed to at-risk NPOs, some of the threats identified were very general and \ninformation provided on TF threats and vulnerabilities were largely based on international \nstudies and lacked specificity in the Korean context. Korea has made progress in ensuring \nthat NPOs at risk of TF abuse are subject to monitoring and supervision, but gaps remain in \nthe application of risk-based supervision. Monitoring efforts for compliance continue to be \nsecondary compared to monitoring of suspected ML/TF activity, and while Korea has some \nability to apply effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions for violations of the \nrequirements applicable to NPOs, the range of sanctions available is relatively limited. \nConsidering the progress made and taking into account Korea’s risk and context,  \nRecommendation 8 is re-rated as Largely Compliant. \n \n \n      | 7 \nKOREA: FOURTH ENHANCED FOLLOW-UP REPORT \n      \nConclusion \nOverall, Korea has made progress in addressing technical compliance deficiencies identified \nin its MER and has been re-rated Largely Compliant with R.8.  \nThe table below shows Korea’s MER ratings and reflects the progress it has made, and any \nre-ratings based on this and previous FURs: \nTable 1.

Confiscation and provisional \nmeasures \nC \n• \nAll criteria met. \n5. Terrorist financing offence \nLC \n• \nThe TF offence incorporates an additional mental element which goes beyond the TF \nConvention. \n• \nThe indirect collection of funds is not clearly covered by the offence. \n• \nThe financing of FTFs is not clearly covered. \n• \nSanctions for TF for legal persons are too low to be proportionate and dissuasive. \n6.
