KOREA: FOURTH ENHANCED FOLLOW-UP REPORT 
      
Korea’s 4th Enhanced Follow-up Report 
Introduction 
The FATF Plenary adopted the mutual evaluation report (MER) of Korea in February 20201. 
Based on the MER results, Korea was placed into enhanced follow-up. Korea did not request 
technical compliance re-ratings in its three previous enhanced Follow Up Reports (FUR) 
(2021-23). This 4th enhanced FUR analyses Korea’s progress in addressing the technical 
compliance deficiencies identified in its MER, relating to Recommendation 8. A re-rating is 
given where sufficient progress has been made. 
Overall, the expectation is that countries will have addressed most, if not all, technical 
compliance deficiencies by the end of the third year from the adoption of their MER. This 
report does not address what progress Korea has made to improve its effectiveness.  
The following expert, supported by Ms. Lisa Kilduff, Policy Analyst within the FATF 
Secretariat, assessed Korea’s request for technical compliance re-ratings:  
• 
Mr. Ian McDonald, Senior Policy Analyst, Royal Canadian Mounted Police 
from Canada. 
The second section of this report summarises Korea’s progress in improving technical 
compliance. The third section sets out the conclusion and includes a table showing Korea’s 
MER ratings and updated ratings based on this and previous FURs. 
Progress to improve Technical Compliance 
This section summarises Korea’s progress to improve its technical compliance by addressing 
some of the technical compliance deficiencies identified in the MER (R.8). 
Progress to address technical compliance deficiencies identified in the 
MER 
Korea has made progress to address the technical compliance deficiencies identified in the 
MER in relation to R.8. Because of this progress, Korea has been re-rated on this 
Recommendation.

Criterion 8.1 (Mostly Met) 
Korea did not fully meet the requirements of this criterion at the time of the 
MER as it had not clearly identified which registered NPOs fell within the FATF 
definition of Non-Profit Organisations (NPO). Furthermore, Korea’s definition 
of ‘public interest corporation’ (PIC) did not strictly align with the FATF 
definition (c.8.1(a)). Since its MER, Korea has taken steps to identify which 
NPOs fall within the FATF definition. As of 2022, Korea identified that there 
was a total of 53 918 Non-Profit Corporations (NPCs) in Korea, which were 
registered with the National Tax Service (NTS) based on in the Corporate Tax 
Act and the Value-added Act. These NPCs all received their unique 
identification numbers issued from the competent tax offices. In consultation 
with the NPO sector, Korea has since imposed the duty of disclosure on NPCs 
to monitor tax evasion, misappropriation of funds and other illicit activities 
and to protect the legitimate activities of NPOs. It has done so by stipulating 
that a person who conducts business for purposes of public service, related to 
religion, charity, or academic studies under the Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax 
Act constitutes a Public Service Corporation (PSC). As of 2022, there were a 
total of 39,273 PSCs that are subject to disclosure requirements under the 
Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax Act (art. 50.3). In general, all PSCs in Korea have 
a duty of disclosure to report settlement statements. However, organisations 
that are determined to be contributing to religious propagation and 
reformation of the people are exempt from this disclosure. As well, small PSCs 
are allowed to make this report through a simple form, to ensure that the 
reporting requirement reflects the risk-based approach being used in Korea. 
Korea has identified 309 internationally active NPOs and 159 NPOs 
conducting religious activities as being at higher risk of TF abuse, and these 
NPOs are subject to the full reporting requirement and cannot qualify for 
simplified reporting measures. Korea has therefore addressed the deficiency 
identified in the MER under c.8.1(a). 
While the 2020 MER found that Korea had made efforts to identify the nature 
of TF threats posed to at-risk NPOs, some of the threats identified were very 
general and information provided on TF threats and vulnerabilities were 
largely based on international studies and lacked specificity in the Korean 
context (c.8.1(b)). In 2023, Korea undertook an assessment of the risks facing 
the NPO sector. This was based on analyses of STR statistics, TF crime 
typologies and interviews with representative agencies from the NPO sector. 
The assessment concluded that NPOs with an international presence are more 
likely to be at risk to TF abuse than domestically active NPOs in Korea. The 
study resulted in findings and guidance that was issued to representative 
agencies as a result by KoFIU. However, limited information has been 
provided on the extent to which Korea identifies the nature nature of threats 
      | 3 
KOREA: FOURTH ENHANCED FOLLOW-UP REPORT 
      
posed by terrorist entities to the NPOs which are at risk as well as how 
terrorist actors abuse those NPOs. The deficiency under c.8.1(b) has only been 
addressed to some extent and the deficiency remains. 
As set out in 2020, KoFIU undertakes reviews of the adequacy of Korea’s 
measures to prevent TF abuse of at-risk NPOs, and the legislative framework 
was considered adequate and risk based. No technical shortcomings were 
identified (c.8.1(c)). Similarly, Korea has periodically reassessed the NPO 
sector to review up-to-date information on its vulnerabilities, the most recent 
of which was undertaken in 2023. The NPOs CFT Agencies Committee meets 
on an ad hoc basis to discuss issues as they arise, including new information 
on risks and vulnerabilities. No technical shortcomings were identified 
(c.8.1(d)). While Korea has addressed deficiencies under c.8.1(a) and made 
progress regarding c.8.1(b) to some extent, shortcomings remain under this 
sub-criterion. Criterion 8.1 remains mostly met. 
Criterion 8.2 (Met)  
Korea did not fully meet the requirements of this criterion at the time of the 
MER due to deficiencies under c.8.2(a)-(c). The MER found that the Guidelines 
on Combating TF Abuse of NPOs were not comprehensive, and while certain 
NPOs were subject to measures and obligations that aim to increase 
transparency 
and 
accountability 
and 
prevent 
TF, 
Korea 
lacked 
comprehensive policies aimed at promoting accountability, integrity and 
public confidence for all NPOs (c.8.2(a)). As at the time of the MER, there are 
policies in place regarding the establishment, control and supervision of PICs 
under the Act on the Establishment and Operation of Public Interest 
Corporations. As noted under c.8.1, since the MER, Korea has established 
policies regarding PSCs under the Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax Act, which are 
subject to reporting requirements and oversight by the NTS. Under the 
Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax Act, PSCs are required to: undertake public 
financial reporting, including details on collection and disbursement of 
donations (art. 50.3); apply accounting standards (art. 50.4); keep records 
and preserve significant evidentiary documents for 10 years from the last date 
of a taxable period of income tax or a business year of corporate tax (art. 51), 
and; undergo tax verification and audit (art. 50). Korea has therefore 
demonstrated that there are policies in place to promote accountability, 
integrity and public confidence in the administration of NPOs, and the 
deficiency under c.8.2(a) has been addressed. 
Regarding c.8.2(b), the MER identified shortcomings in Korea’s outreach 
efforts, noting that they did not include certain high-risk NPOs or donor 
communities. Since 2020, the Korean government has reinforced its outreach 
activities to strengthen awareness among NPOs about their potential 
vulnerabilities to TF risks and abuse. Such activities include holding a 
roundtable meeting with three representative agencies from the NPO sector 
(GuideStar, KCOC, KCMS), with a focus on internationally active NPOs 
considered at-risk to TF abuse and working alongside NPOs to develop 
educational materials on the subject. The technical shortcomings have 
therefore been addressed under c.8.2(b).  
While the KoFIU Guidelines on Combatting TF Abuse of NPOs include best 
practices for addressing TF risks and vulnerabilities, the MER noted a minor 
4 |       
KOREA: FOURTH ENHANCED FOLLOW-UP REPORT 
      
deficiency regarding the lack of NPO input into the development or 
refinement of the guidelines (c.8.2(c)). Since the MER, in addition to the 
guidelines, Korea has developed checklists that allow the NPO sector to self-
assess their exposure to potential TF risks and abuse, which can be filtered by 
regulation, area of activity and risk level. The three representative agencies 
(GuideStar, KCOC, KCMS) participated in the development of said checklists, 
which have been distributed to at-risk NPOs. Considering this progress, the 
technical deficiencies under c.8.2(c) have been addressed. 
As set out in 2020, all NPOs are required to use regulated financial channels 
and provide information on their accounts to the NTS (Inheritance Tax and 
Gift Tax Act, art.50-2). Development aid NPOs are also subject to additional 
requirements to conduct transactions through certified bank accounts or 
regulated financial channels (Korea International Cooperation Agency Act, 
art.22-2). No technical deficiencies were identified (c.8.2(d)). Considering the 
progress made under c.8.2(a)-(c), this criterion is now considered met. 
Criterion 8.3 (Mostly Met)  
The 2020 MER found that while Korea had some measures in place to promote 
supervision and monitoring of NPOs and demonstrate that the measures 
applied to NPOs were risk-based, half of the country’s higher-risk NPO 
population were not subject to adequate reporting or disclosure 
requirements. As noted under c.8.1, PSCs are now subject to reporting 
requirements under the Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax Act, including NPOs 
identified as higher risk2. NPOs that are not defined as a PSC but that have 
profit-making business must submit financial statements to the competent tax 
office (art. 60, Corporate Tax Act) and report the inheritance tax, if the 
organisation receives tangible or intangible property (art. 4.2, Inheritance Tax 
and Gift Tax Act). NPOs identified as high risk are now subject to duty of 
disclosure and subsequent monitoring, as noted under c.8.1(a). However, it is 
not entirely clear if NPOs that  submit a simpler disclosure form are doing so 
because of their asset size alone or if there is consideration of the TF risk. 
Korea has made progress in ensuring that NPOs at risk of TF abuse are subject 
to monitoring and supervision, but gaps remain in the application of risk-
based supervision. 
Criterion 8.4 (Partly Met)  
As outlined under c.8.3, the 2020 MER found deficiencies regarding the 
monitoring of higher-risk NPOs in Korea. While the MER notes that many 
NPOs are subject to ongoing and strict scrutiny to prevent misuse of public 
funds, which indirectly contributes to TF prevention, this does not extend to 
all NPOs identified as high risk (c.8.4(a)). Furthermore, monitoring is focused 
on criminal activity rather than compliance with R.8 requirements. The MER 
did however note that Korea’s monitoring and supervisions systems were 
generally consistent with Korea’s risk profile. The efforts undertaken by 
 
2  There are nine organisations that are exempt from reporting requirements, five of which do 
not meet the definition of NPO under the FATF Standards and four that failed to comply with 
disclosure obligations pursuant to Article 50.3 of the Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax Act. In 
case of failure to comply with this obligation in 2024, they will be required to pay additional 
tax pursuant to Article 78.11 of the Act. 
      | 5 
KOREA: FOURTH ENHANCED FOLLOW-UP REPORT 
      
Korea on outreach and guidance through the self-checklist as described under 
c.8.2 are useful tools for improving understanding of TF risks on the part of 
NPOs. However, these efforts do not address the deficiency identified in the 
MER under c.8.4(a), namely that monitoring efforts for compliance continue 
to be secondary compared to monitoring of suspected ML/TF activity. The 
technical deficiencies under c.8.4(a) therefore remain. 
Regarding c.8.4(b), as set out in 2020, Korea has some ability to apply 
effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions for violations of the 
requirements applicable to NPOs. Registrars can deregister NPOs for breaches 
of their financial reporting obligations (Civil Act, art.38; Act on the 
Establishment and Operation of Public Interest Corporations, art.16) and the 
NTS can also sanction such breaches by imposing additional tax. While no 
sanctions are available for the NPO’s officers, where a NPO collects donations 
outside its specified collection plan, the NPO or its officer(s) can face 
imprisonment of up to three years or a fine of KRW 30 million (EUR 23 500) 
(Act on Collection and Use of Donations, art.4, 10, 16). The MER deemed the 
range of sanctions available to be relatively limited, which may reduce Korea’s 
ability to impose proportionate sanctions. Korea does not appear to have 
made new sanctions available for breaches of compliance with R.8 and the 
technical shortcomings remain. The deficiencies remain under c.8.4. 
Criterion 8.5 (Met)  
Korea did not fully meet the requirements of this criterion at the time of the 
MER. While Korea ensures cooperation and coordination between authorities 
with information on NPOs through the NPOs CFT Agencies Committee, this 
committee and other mechanisms did not include all NPO registrars, which 
was deemed as detrimental to information sharing on NPOs (c.8.5(a)). Since 
the MER, to promote effective cooperation, coordination, and information 
exchange between related agencies that hold NPO information, the NPO CFT 
Agencies Committee was established under the purview of the KoFIU. 
Participating agencies include the Office for Government Coordination, 
National Intelligence Service, Ministry of the Interior and Safety, NTS, National 
Police Agency, Financial Supervisory Service, and Korea International 
Cooperation Agency (KOICA). The consultative group adjourns to discuss 
policies, inspections, education and outreach programmes and information 
sharing, with a focus on how to protect NPOs from TF abuse. As NPOs are now 
defined as Public Service Corporations under the Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax 
Act, the NTS is the competent authority that manages and oversees the 
registration of NPOs in Korea (as of 2022). The NTS takes part in the Council, 
and as such, the deficiency identified under c.8.5(a) has been resolved. 
As set out in 2020, competent authorities can carry out investigations into 
NPOs suspected of TF abuse (c.8.5(b)), the NPA is able to obtain information 
on the administration and management of NPOs through various channels 
(c.8.5(c)) and the NPOs CFT Agencies Committee and Counter-Terrorism 
Committee provide mechanisms for sharing suspicions of NPO abuse with 
relevant authorities, including the NPA for investigation. NPO registrars are 
aware of the TF risks in the sector, in part due to outreach on this topic, and 
know to report any suspicions to the NPA (c.8.5(d)). No technical deficiencies 
were identified regarding c.8.5(b)-(d). Given that the technical shortcoming 
under c.8.5(a) has been addressed, this criterion is now met.

KOREA: FOURTH ENHANCED FOLLOW-UP REPORT 
      
Criterion 8.6 (Met) 
As set out in 2020, international requests for information regarding NPOs 
suspected of TF abuse are dealt with in the same was as any other request for 
information. KoFIU, the NPA or other competent authorities can informally 
provide information as described in R.40 of the MER. Where one agency 
receives a request for information relevant to another agency, the NPOs CFT 
Agencies Committee provides contact points through which such requests can 
be shared. Foreign parties may also obtain public financial or administrative 
information through GuideStar or the NTS. 
Weighting and conclusion: Korea has taken steps to address the deficiencies identified in 
its 2020 MER. Korea has identified which NPOs fall within the FATF definition and since 
2022, subjected PSCs to duty of disclosure under the Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax Act. These 
PSCs are subject to supervision and monitoring, in line with the risk-based approach. KoFIU 
undertakes reviews of the adequacy of Korea’s measures to prevent TF abuse of at-risk NPOs, 
and the legislative framework is adequate and risk based. Korea periodically reassesses the 
NPO sector to review up-to-date information on its vulnerabilities and the NPOs CFT 
Agencies Committee meets on an ad hoc basis. Korea ensures that NPOs are subject to 
measures and obligations that aim to increase transparency and accountability and prevent 
TF and has established policies to promote accountability, integrity and public confidence in 
the administration of NPOs under the Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax Act. Outreach efforts and 
activities have been strengthened through roundtable meetings with representative agencies 
from the NPO sector with a focus on internationally active NPOs considered at-risk to TF 
abuse. With the participation of representative agencies, Korea has developed checklists that 
allow the NPO sector to self-assess their exposure to potential TF risks and abuse, and all 
NPOs are required to use regulated financial channels and provide information on their 
accounts to the NTS. Korea ensures that there are effective information gathering and 
coordination mechanisms in place, namely through the NPO CFT Agencies Committee, and 
competent authorities can carry out investigations into NPOs suspected of TF abuse. 
Information is readily available to competent authorities and NPO registrars are aware of the 
TF risks in the sector. KoFIU deals with international requests for information regarding 
NPOs suspected of TF abuse adequately.     
However, some deficiencies remain. While Korea has made efforts to identify the nature of 
TF threats posed to at-risk NPOs, some of the threats identified were very general and 
information provided on TF threats and vulnerabilities were largely based on international 
studies and lacked specificity in the Korean context. Korea has made progress in ensuring 
that NPOs at risk of TF abuse are subject to monitoring and supervision, but gaps remain in 
the application of risk-based supervision. Monitoring efforts for compliance continue to be 
secondary compared to monitoring of suspected ML/TF activity, and while Korea has some 
ability to apply effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions for violations of the 
requirements applicable to NPOs, the range of sanctions available is relatively limited. 
Considering the progress made and taking into account Korea’s risk and context,  
Recommendation 8 is re-rated as Largely Compliant.
